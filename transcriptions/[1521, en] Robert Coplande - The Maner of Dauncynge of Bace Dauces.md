Here foloweth the maner of dauncynge of bace dauces after the use of fraunce & other places translated out of frenche in englyshe by Robert coplande.

For to daunce ony[^1] bace daunce there behoueth.iiii pacis, that is to wite syngle, double: repryse, & braule. And ye ought fyrst to make reuerence towarde the lady, & than make .ii. syngles .i. double, a repryse, a braule. And this rule ye ought alway to kepe at the beginnynge, as it is sayd. And somtyme is made .ii. syngles after the doubles, & before the reprinses *sic*, & that is done whan the measures ben parfite. Also whan ony songe or daunce is wryten .R. betokeneth reuerence. By .ss. double betokeneth .ii. syngle paces, & by .d. betokeneth .i. double pace. And yf there be. ddd. ye ought to make iii. doubles after as the daunce requyreth, for somtyme is made but .i. double, & somtime iii. or .v. one after another, and therfore is ddddd. thus wryten. And whan .r. is wryten it betokeneth, repryse. & yf .rrr. be wryten it signyfieth .iii. repryses, & .rrrrr. betokeneth five. For ye ought never to make .ii. nor .iiii togyder, nor of the doubles also, for the doubles & the repryses ben[^2] ever odde in nombre.

[^1]: any

[^2]: The last character is imperfectly printed

Also all bace daunces begyn by syngles or reuerence, and ende with braule[^3].

[^3]: Coplande here inserts his symbol which elsewhere in the tract indicates a new paragraph, but in this one case he does so without beginning the following text on a new line

Also it behoveth to knowe the nombre of notes of every bace daunce, & the paces after the measure of the notes. Therefore ye ought to wyte that fyrst ye ought to make reuerence with the lyfte fote, & than a braule with the right fote, than two syngle paces, the fyrst with the lyfte fote and the seconde with the ryght fote in goynge forwarde, & ye must reyse[^4] your body.

[^4]: raise

The fyrst double pace is made with the lyft fote in reysynge[^5] the body steppynge .iii. pace forwarde lyghtly, the fyrst with the lyfte fote, the seconde with the ryght fote, & the thyrde with the lyft fote, as the fyrst.

[^5]: raising

The seconde double pace begynneth with the ryght fote goynge thre paces forwarde as is sayd of the fyrst in reysynge the body. &c.

The thyrd double pace is done as the first.

It is to note that there be never .ii. double paces togyder, for the doubles & repryses be euer odde in nombre .i.iii. or .v. &c.

A repryse alone ought to be made with the ryght fote in drawynge the ryght fote bakwarde a lytyll to the other fote.

The seconde repryse ought to be made (whan ye make .iii. at ones[^6]) with the lyft fote in reysynge the body in lyke wyse.

[^6]: once

The thyrde repryse is made in place and as the fyrst also.

And merke[^7] for all that is sayd that every of these paces occupyeth as moche tyme the one as the other. That is to wyte. a reuerence, one note. a double, one note. two syngles one note. a repryse, one note. a braule, one note.

[^7]: mark

And ye ought to wyte that in some places of fraunce they call the repryses, desmarches and the braule they call, conge. in englyshe leue[^8].

[^8]: leave

This done ye ought to put in wrytynge for a repryse .r. & for thre reprises thus rrr, and for the braule thus .b.
