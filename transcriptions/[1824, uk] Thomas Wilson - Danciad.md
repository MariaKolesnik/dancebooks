### Dedication

To teachers of merit, (particularly those at whose request the Danciad was composed, and who are most capable of deciding how far the author has done justice to the subject) he respectfully dedicates this work,

Academy of Dancing, 3, Kirby Street, Hatton Garden.

7th June 1824.

### Preface

The Danciad is founded on a dramatic prelude to the Author's 89th Public Ball, held the 30th October 1822 (when the characters were represented by himself and three of his pupils) being intended as a descriptive sketch on the present state of ball-room dancing teachers and professors of dancing, academies, public balls, &c. &c.

The sketch being approved, was afterwards shown, in manuscript, to several eminent teachers, who strongly advised the author to continue the subject; as the various puffs and delusive advertisements of certain persons styling themselves "Professors of Dancing" tended to bring even the art itself into disrepute, and loudly called for exposure and reprehension; however, what was every body's business was no-body's; though all continued to complain of injuries sustained in consequence of such practices, yet none attempted to draw on them the attention of the public. The author was therefore urged to continue and extend his sketch; he in vain represented the difficulty of making it into a poem without new-modelling the subject, a task that he had neither time nor ability to execute. It was replied, that regularity of form was not regarded by them. "Go on (they exclaimed) we care not about form", and to their suggestion he yielded.

So the author endeavoured to take up the cause by exposing mean tricks and explaining the laws; to caution the public against some impostors, Those self-named "professors" yclept dancing masters. How the task is performed, must be judged of by those Who well know the art, and such quackery oppose:

He has now explained his motives for writing, and the circumstances which gave rise to this little work, the object of which is to investigate the merits and claims of certain professors and teachers of dancing to that title ; to expose the delusive tricks and stratagems employed to obtain pupils ; also to explain the mode of admission to, and method of conducting certain rooms termed " Académies for Dancing", and to show the nature and quality of what are frequently called "Grand, Select, Characteristic, Friendly, Dress, Free, Subscription, and Charity Balls; likewise to enable teachers and the public Clearly to understand the laws relative to dancing, which are stated very fully in the work, and are also copied in the notes verbatim; from the act of parliament.

> Though he narrates in verse, no modern poet
>
> Deals less in fiction—(he has proofs to show if);
>
> If, circumstances should give room for doubt,
>
> He trusts his documents will bear him out,
>
> And show it is not invention, nor from spleen,
>
> But what exists, has been, or may be seen.

He is aware that the Danciad, in its present form, is not either a satyric poem or a dramatic piece; but,

> Regardless what the world may say,
>
> He has wrote the Danciad his own way;
>
> Has neither kept to rhyme nor rules,
>
> Nor tacked himself to ancient schools;
>
> But has, like Tristram Shandy gone
>
> Into digressions wide and long;
>
> From East to West, has breathless run,
>
> Then sauntered back where he began,
>
> Knowing sometimes variety
>
> Excuses impropriety;
>
> If readers ask the reason why
>
> He didn't with usual forms comply,
>
> His motives were for running riot,
>
> To caution rogues and make fools quiet.

Should his attempt succeed, it will be some consolation risking the censure of critics, for having deviated from established rules, but which, from the peculiar nature of the work, he considered it was sometimes necessary ; and that usual methods would have been ineffectual in exposing those sharks who have too long remained undiscovered, feasting on the silly gudgeons which come in their way.

Independent of the author's own knowledge on the subject, he has been supplied, during the progress of the work, through the medium of several professional persons, with accounts of various stratagems and devices of those self-created, self-entitled "Professors" till then unknown to him; and still

> There's some, who're not to justice yet been brought,
>
> Who've sinned for years, but never have been caught,
>
> But are well known, and cautioned to desist,
>
> As they'll be closely watched, should they persist.

He has withheld, for the present, the names of the parties alluded to; but, if he has not been sufficiently explicit, he must, in a future edition, be obliged, like a bad painter, to write the name at bottom.

> The Author yet, has not disclosed the name
>
> Of those in fault, however they've been to blame;
>
> But should they think that their true picture's shown,
>
> And that they see a face just like their own,
>
> He grants to those, and all the cap may fit,
>
> His full permission now for wearing it.

But although he has refrained from naming the parties, yet, he trusts they will be easily discovered by their condemnation of the work and abuse of the Author; for like the creaking wheel in the fable, it is very natural for them to cry out under affliction.

> If he's condemned by those he meant to hit,
>
> It will he a proof he has made his caps to fit,
>
> For when fools bark, and rogues begin to cry,
>
> There is a proof that retribution's nigh.

It is hoped the notes will show he has not taken up the subject without sufficient grounds for his assertions, for which he has ample confirmation, having in his possession most of the cards, bills, and advertisements issued by the parties.

He has entirely abstained from allusions to family circumstances, and personal misfortunes which ought never to be the subject of ridicule, although they have been, too frequently, to the disgrace of some of our best authors; and perhaps he might in some measure have been justified in retaliating even personalities, after the illiberality of certain parties, and he can affirm without fear of contradiction, that

> He's uninfluenced, aids no partial cause,
>
> Nor strives to censure, to obtain applause.

The Author's motives for this publication will probably be attributed to various causes; some persons will accuse him of self-interest, but he is quite convinced, if they had published as much, and as variously us he has, they would acquit him of that charge. Books published by a humble individual (not a bookseller) seldom pay even for paper and printing, much less any remuneration for authorship; he forms this opinion from his own experience, believing it to be well known that

> The author has, on dancing, published more
>
> Than any teacher ever did before.
>
> His works, though praised by teachers of renown,
>
> And bought by half the masters in the town,
>
> Have never yet enabled him to dine
>
> On sumptuous viands, nor with Tokay wine
>
> To treat his friends, and toast the sacred nine:
>
> He therefore fears his time's been badly spent.
>
> They ride who bought, he walks who did invent;
>
> And like some authors, printed to his cost,
>
> Has time, and labour, and invention lost,
>
> And had his brightest prospects often crossed:
>
> Yet, with this consolation, wrote again,
>
> That all great authors of the like complain;
>
> For works of merit do not always sell,
>
> And this sad truth even Milton once could tell.
>
> The drama next he was resolved to try,
>
> And for the stage, strove something to supply;
>
> To this was prompted, as heed heard it said,
>
> A thousand pounds for many a piece was paid;
>
> So he resolved to try with prose and rhyme,
>
> And strove to keep the unities of time,
>
> And printed too, did all within his power,
>
> And fondly hoped to catch the golden shower,
>
> To fill his coffers and extend his name,
>
> But that long looked-for shower never came,
>
> Like many authors, now, of self renown,
>
> Curses the taste and judgement of the town;
>
> Yet still writes on, and, for excuse, pretends
>
> He only writes to serve and please his friends,
>
> And has resolved another course to take,
>
> To try if he can't reparation make
>
> For loss in writing for the ball and stage,
>
> By lashing some impostors of the age.
>
> This to effect, he now to satire flies,
>
> And runs to Pope and Byron for supplies;
>
> For good examples, and what words to choose,
>
> And also how, and when, and where to use
>
> Triplets, digressions, and a clenching line,
>
> That in itself doth sound and sense combine,
>
> He reads them over, steals a line or so,
>
> His verse to strengthen, and his powers to show,
>
> But hopes the critics and the world won't know.
>
> At dancing masters he has bent his aim,
>
> But only those who have assumed the name.
>
> Some time ago, he warned them to desist,
>
> Or heed expose such plans as did exist
>
> To trick the public; but they still persist,
>
> And treat the author's warnings with a sneer,
>
> And cry "From such a wight there's nought to fear.
>
> His book will neither sell nor read, but soon
>
> Make paper lanterns to assist the moon".
>
> Should this take place, there's few with hopes of gain
>
> Would go his halves, and satisfied remain.

He therefore fears that the present edition will be the Alpha and Omega of the Danciad, unless some of the professors alluded to should recognize their own likenesses, and reply, thereby furnishing the author with new materials for another edition, in which he may probably be obliged to unmask some of those characters; but,

> Till they become the personal aggressors,
>
> He'll hide real names, and only use "professors".

Should these predictions be fulfilled, (as perhaps they may), no profit will accrue to him from the present publication.

With these apprehensions, he has printed only a very small edition, as his greatest expectations as to the sale do not extend beyond supplying his subscribers, and disposing of a few copies to those persons who may expect to see, in this work, the old adage verified, which says,

> "There's always rare sport (and with this hope will buy)
>
> To see a goose dance, and a fool versify".

Nor has he the expectation of a dedication fee. As the Danciad comes forth, without being dedicated, as usual, to a rich and noble patron, which is not, however, omitted in consequence of the author being too rich to refuse the fee, nor would his readers be easily persuaded he was induced to reject it on the score of independence, as

> The threadbare author, who, in sounding verse,
>
> Makes light of thousands, seldom has in purse
>
> Enough of current cola to answer all
>
> The rude demands of those who chance to call,
>
> And free his door from those alarming knocks
>
> Which give poetic ears such dreadful shocks;
>
> Or make the bard, for virtue's sake, disdain
>
> The great to flatter, for the hope of gain.

He fears his purse will not be the only sufferer, by the omission of a suitable dedication to some rich and noble patron, but that the public will never, in any other way, hear of the very extraordinary virtues and acquirements that such a patron must of course possess. Therefore,

> This may deprive the world of something they
>
> Could never hear of any other way,
>
> How his great patron was for wisdom famed,
>
> Whose modest virtues all the town proclaimed;
>
> Whose genius, talents, and acquirements, were
>
> Quite super human, and beyond compare:
>
> Such skill in arts and learning all confess
>
> None but rich patrons ever can possess.

The Author can assure the Public, that he did not withhold the dedication, nor dispense with the fee, in order to be revenged on the rich, for retaining all the money, and leaving him none, although he is often declaiming in defence of virtuous poverty; but the truth is, that he quite despaired of ever finding so kind and liberal a patron, having heard that

> Poets too oft, for want of bread, not fame,
>
> To gain a patron, have extolled his name;
>
> But, after sacrificing truth and time,
>
> Have often found that neither prose nor rhyme
>
> Could gain the bard the dedication fee,
>
> The patron was so mean or dull, that he
>
> The author's merit would or could not see.
>
> To gain a fee the author has no hope,
>
> For dedication fees expired with Pope.
>
> He therefore dedicates his piece to those
>
> Some of whom were and still may be his foes.
>
> He has been told it is prudent to be civil,
>
> And sometimes hold a candle to the Devil.

Not only has the author been without a rich patron and a dedication fee, but he has never received any pecuniary assistance from his subscribers in the publication of this work, the conditions being not to pay till delivery, and the price only 5s, whatever may be the size or extent of the book; beyond which he has only this forlorn hope, as

> His subscribers belong to the family race
>
> Of the Capers, well known for their figures and grace,
>
> Who he hopes are too proud and too rich to abuse
>
> A very good custom subscribers did use,
>
> When the copy's presented, the change to refuse.

This expectation, he fears, is only one of the poet's golden dreams, which perhaps will never be realized. Others, though they may not think authorship very profitable, would yet accuse him of motives of vanity; but he trusts that the following declaration will exonerate him from that charge, for

> He is not yet quite vain enough to give
>
> A card address to where he does not live;
>
> Nor boast of plenty, when the mice can show
>
> For want they left his cupboard long ago;
>
> Nor talk of dinners which he never ate,
>
> Nor run in debt to give a foolish treat;
>
> Nor vain enough, when he does hunger feel,
>
> To fast, because the hour is not genteel,
>
> Nor for the fashion to be starved alive,
>
> But eats at twelve, and will not wait till five.
>
> He's not ashamed to own he wanted pelf,
>
> Nor envies dancers better than himself;
>
> Is not abashed a former friend to meet,
>
> Because they knew each other in the Fleet.
>
> He boasts no conquests which he never made,
>
> Disowns no friends because they live by trade;
>
> Nor brags of means when be does hardly know
>
> Which way to turn, to escape from Richard Roe.

Although, after making this declaration, the author might be acquitted of either interest or vanity, yet there are some who might perhaps attribute this work to splenetic motives; but this he can affirm, (and, like many other authors, hopes to be believed too), that spleen has not in the least influenced him, not having any individual pique or personal animosity against any person alluded to in the work, only that natural indignation excited by the conduct of those who have resorted to the various deceptive tricks and unfair practices complained of, but must confess he cannot say quite so much for himself on the score of envy, as

> He envies those who can for nothing give
>
> Both time and dancing, yet like princes live;
>
> And all those teachers who have the art to show
>
> Their pupils dances, which themselves don't know;
>
> And those who to a lesson can foretell,
>
> (Be who they may) when pupils call dance well;
>
> And those who've had "machines for waltzing made,
>
> To teach the art without a master's aid";
>
> And some great teachers, who do scarce know how
>
> To teach the chassée, or to make the bow
>
> Who never drudged for excellence or fame,
>
> Yet notwithstanding have acquired a name,
>
> And keep a carriage, live in great repute,
>
> Whilst talent walks, and in a threadbare suit
>
> And those "who've lately brought to light an art
>
> That common teachers never can impart".
>
> He envies those who any dance can take,
>
> And in six lessons perfect pupils make,
>
> And conscientiously to them can say,
>
> "You now dance well, can ease and grace display".

These and the several other super-human acquirements said to be possessed by certain professors of dancing, have excited the author's envy. In his defence, the calls on those eminent teachers who know the fallibility of human nature, to read these extraordinary professions, and then say whether they do not also envy those great professors such rare qualifications, and to this subject he particularly entreats the attention of eminent foreign dancers, who have so long laughed at our want of genius in the art of dancing.

> Read this, ye Opera principals, and own.
>
> Is not your system now defective grown?
>
> They perfect dancers make before you know
>
> The five positions, or can point the toe.
>
> Tell Gallia's sons, John Bull's now learnt to dance,
>
> Has got new methods, and can vie with France.

The Author's further remarks and opinions on these matters must be reserved for another place, as he finds he has already terribly digressed, for which he offers the following apology:

> Now, with critics a truce,
>
> For he has an excuse,
>
> Having seen near a score
>
> Who have done so before.
>
> Some are authors of note
>
> Whose names he could quote,
>
> Whose books, by confession,
>
> Are all a digression.
>
> You'll find Sterne and Swift
>
> Gave digressions a lift;
>
> And in Byron it is found
>
> That they often abound;
>
> Yet most will agree,
>
> That his like they can't see.
>
> If you say this excuse
>
> Will be here of no use,
>
> Perhaps there's one more
>
> That will outweigh a score,
>
> Which you must confess,
>
> If you reason possess.
>
> It is this: we are frail,
>
> And our foibles prevail
>
> For Dame Nature, we find,
>
> To our faults makes us blind.
>
> So the critics have said
>
> Of great Milton that's dead.

Should neither precedents nor apologies prevail	— with some critics, who think

> He must jog on the usual way
>
> And neither look aside nor stray,
>
> Whatever the prospect may present,
>
> But keep the road that others went.
>
> Yet he has risked their indignation,
>
> And followed his own inclination,
>
> And often runs through thorns and briars,
>
> It expose impostors, rogues, fools, and liars.

That an author is not the best judge of his own performance, is generally admitted: whether the digressions into which the Author of the Danciad has been led are justifiable or not, and with what portion of ability he has executed the task assigned to him, he presumes not to determine; but, whatever opinion his readers may form on that subject, he at least hopes to be acquitted of unworthy motives. In yielding to the request of his subscribers, he has been influenced only by the wish of guarding the public against impositions, and of rescuing the honourable part of the profession from sharing in the odium that ought not to be indiscriminately attached. With such patrons and encouragers of his work, it may be doubted, whether he can say, like others, "he was prompted to the undertaking by the advice of his friends , for the old adage says, "two of a trade", &c.

He also hopes the unpoetical diction, as well as the want of smoothness in some of the lines, will be excused, the subject being rather argumentative than poetical, and the work abounding with technical terms and expressions, and it being requisite to quote, as closely as possibly, not only the modes of expression in particular advertisements, bills, and cards, but even clauses of the act of parliament relative to dancing.

> The critics, he hopes, will remember it was writ
>
> By a dancer, and they are not famed for their wit.
>
> Of the truth of this axiom to all he appeals,
>
> Per their merit, it is said, mostly lies in their heels
>
> And by one who has neither much leisure nor pelf,
>
> Who, when pupils apply, gives the lesson himself.
>
> If the author in triplets does largely abound,
>
> In Pope and in Dryden they're plentiful found;
>
> And even great Johnson advises their use,
>
> "Till, we've got something better we can introduce";
>
> And, should you dispute that they judgement did lack,
>
> You'll have Gifford, Southey, and Moore on your back;
>
> So, be how it may, if its merits are tried,
>
> He has authors and poets of note on his side,
>
> Who are known for their zeal, and whole volumes would write.
>
> In case of dispute, to prove themselves right,
>
> Should his subject and sentences end rather rude,
>
> Should his triplets not always the sentence conclude,
>
> Should his verse sometimes hobble and periods seem crude,
>
> He says, for excuse, that his subject's not epic,
>
> But argumentative, and partly dramatic,
>
> And hopes that this reason will weigh with the critic.

But it may, perhaps, be said that this apology might have been spared, had the Author engaged some able versifier to round his periods and correct his numbers, who certainly might have amended the poetry; but a technical knowledge of the subject was also indispensably necessary, as it appears was once experienced by Hogarth the artist, in his " Analysis of Beauty " who slates that he at first availed himself of the assistance of a literary friend, who not having a technical knowledge of drawing and painting, made rather an elegant literary disquisition than a scientific and technical treatise, and the artist was consequently compelled afterwards to write the work himself.

The Author of the following lines has, therefore, used his own mode, and if he has egregiously sinned against the rules of rhyme and reason, must in his turn expect to be subject, like others, both to reprehension and neglect.

Though the opening of the Danciad may be said to be on the subject of jealousy, and perhaps appear irrelevant to the object of the work, the original form has be en retained, as leading to other matters, and is now entitled, "the Introduction"; and though the imitations of the various styles and methods of dancing quadrilles, waltzes, reels, and country dances, cannot of course be properly explained, but by representation; yet, in order to preserve the form of the original sketch, he has retained the part where such imitations were introduced. The Laws relative to Dancing , the Subject of Public Balls , and above half that portion which is under the head of " Professors of Dancing "; were not in the original sketch, but, with various other alterations and additions, have been subsequently introduced.

It may be necessary to remark, that many circumstances appertaining to the same party are sometimes given in different places: this has arisen from their having partly transpired whilst the work was printing.

He fears the work will not please the critics the subject being not only limited but technical: however, should it satisfy those for whom it was written, he shall consider himself fortunate; and should it not, after his best endeavours, meet their expectation, they will recollect it was their approval of a portion of the work that induced him to finish it.

He also apprehends, that it may not please a respectable portion of the profession, who, though feeling the justice of the remarks, and assured they apply not to themselves, would yet be unwilling to concur in such sentiments, lest they should offend their visiting acquaintances, as

> There may be truth, too strong, perhaps, for those
>
> Who only tacitly such tricks oppose.
>
> But he speaks boldly, hides no faults for gain,
>
> And cares not if impostors should complain.
>
> Alike to him their censure or applause;
>
> He hopes with justice to maintain his cause.
>
> Though on him hurled Ernulphus's dread curse,
>
> If he's traduced or slandered, which is worse.
>
> Though this should happen, he will not desist,
>
> But will expose impostors who persist.
>
> He'll not be neutral, but will speak his mind,
>
> Regardless if he friends or foes may find.

Notwithstanding which, he is, however, quite Willing to submit with deference to candid public opinion: yet

> He'll not be quietly condemned by fools,
>
> Or costermonger teachers, or their tools,
>
> But will reply, aye, over and over again,
>
> And prove he has grounds and reason to complain.
>
> Yet to be judged will willingly submit,
>
> By those who have candour, judgement, taste, and wit;
>
> And such as can the subject comprehend,
>
> And know the cause he labours to defend.
>
> If those condemn him, then he'll not complain,
>
> But either mend, or never write again.

The author fears, that with apologies, comparisons, defences, confessions, allusions, digressions, quotations, and invocations, both in prose and verse, he must, by this time, have tired his readers: he will therefore detain them no longer,

> Ending his preface with this exclamation
>
> To teachers and all pupils in the nation:
>
> "Let dancing-masters now draw near,
>
> "I'll whisper something in their ear,
>
> "That shall to some be recreation,
>
> "To others dire abomination.
>
> "Let those who've both cheap dancing dear,
>
> "(Pupils I mean) let them draw near,
>
> "And watch the shadows as they pass,
>
> " And see their likeness in the glass".

>
> The first of dancer's who have ever been
>

>
> Bel. Your knowledge of the art none can deny,

>
> To teachers of this class I don't allude
>
> In my remarks; such teachers I exclude;
>
> And only aim at those well-known impostors,
>
> Self-titled, self-created dancing masters,
>
> Whose teaching is a libel on those elves,
>
> Disgraceful to their pupils and themselves;
>
> Who cheat all persons they attempt to show,
>
> Of time and money, as they nothing know,
>
> But mongrel stuff, nonsensical; absurd,

>
> Jem. I know both classes well, and every day

> A name assumed by every paltry wight,
>
> Who scarce can run the hey; yet will abuse
>
> Those teachers, though not fit to chalk their shoes;
>
> These mean impostors bring to disrepute,
>
> This polite art, and teachers of repute.
>
> Bel. And libel both as spleen or interest suit.
>
> Jem. Nothing like science do they teach or know,
>
> They are quacks in dancing, which I'll plainly show.
>
> Bel. They're quacks indeed, if you their bills survey,
>
> And weigh their talent well with what they say;
>
> They every dance propose to teach, and well,
>
> Though they the five positions scarce can tell.
>
> Jem. There was a time, and that not long ago,
>

>
> The Art of Dancing well, and that explain,
>
> Ere they could fame or pupils hope to gain;
>
> When talent only could command respect,
>
> And pupils could impostors soon detect;
>
> When Bishop taught, and Slingsby graced the stage,
>
> And when less talent scarce would please the age,
>
> Who vied with all the dancers then in France,
>
> And taught their pupils gracefully to dance;
>
> Whose pupils danced with much more grace than those,
>
> Who now for teachers on the town impose:
>
> Teachers of dancing were considered then,
>
> As well informed and polished gentlemen:
>
> There were few teachers then, but why you'll ask,
>
> Because but few dare undertake the task;
>
> But teachers now with blacking-makers vie,
>
> In number and in puff to catch the eye;
>
> They multiply like insects in the sun,
>
> Some hobble forth; some hop, whilst others run,
>
> All term themselves "professors", and engage
>
> To fit you for the ball-room or the stage;
>
> A quarter's dancing, and a flaming bill
>
> Now make a teacher, and proclaim his skill;
>
> A few quadrilles, a hornpipe, reel or so,
>
> Are quite as much as many teachers know;
>
> In every shop or corner of a street,
>
> Some new Professor's bill of fare you meet;
>
> Go round or through the town which way you will,
>
> You're sure to see some dancing master's bill;
>
> On every wall or fence their hills are seen,
>
> From east to west, from Bow to Turnham Green;
>
> They teach for prices any dance you choose,
>
> For less than shoe-blacks charge for blacking shoes;
>
> They all "Professors" write, and on the wall,
>
> They seem to vie with Vestris and with Paul.
>
> Try them, see their pupils dance, then proclaim
>
> Whether "Professor" does become their name.
>
> One "gratis gives a month", says, "come and try",
>
> As they cry walnuts, "taste before you buy".
>
> Some advertise, that "if you do not learn
>
> In certain time, the money they'll return";
>
> Quack doctors like, who advertise to say,
>
> Their terms to patients are "no cure no pay".
>
> "To give four months for three", there's one agrees,
>
> By way of blessing, as they give with peas.
>
> Others less modest still demand some pay,
>
> And for one guinea, in six lessons they
>
> Will teach completely, any dance you will;
>
> Minuet, gavotte, waltzing, or quadrille;
>
> And some, who on their talents can't depend,
>
> A picture of their room to shops they send,
>
> To hang in windows that they may be seen,
>
> Just like a grocer's nodding Mandarin;
>
> They know fools gape at, pictures; nay, believe
>
> All they see is true, and thus themselves deceived;
>
> Other devices not less strange they try,
>
> Their objects to surprise and catch the eye.
>
> Bel. They all condemn each other, say they'll show
>
> That they alone the art of dancing know;
>
> Each other's plans they publicly disown,
>
> As each has got a method of his own;
>
> They all possess great talents, so they say,
>
> (And printed papers are all true!) then they
>
> Must be the greatest masters of the day.
>
> Jem. But printed statements often prove to be,
>
> Except in print a mere nonentity;
>
> These proofs in plenty have occurred to me:
>
> Each teacher shows great talent by his bill,
>
> Just read it over, you'll wonder at his skill,
>
> There every dance is named, and they engage,
>
> To make their pupils wonders of the age;
>
> In a few lessons and at small expense,
>
> One guinea is all they ask us recompense.
>
> Bel. With these proposals they must all deceive,
>
> Who in their bills implicitly believe.
>
> Jem. It is only those they catch who have never been,
>
> At balls or theatres, where good dancing's seen;
>
> With that experience they would soon discern,
>
> Their masters ought themselves to go and learn.
>
> Bel. Are they unconscious of their own defects;
>
> Or is it impudence that them protects?
>
> Jem. Of impudence they've no deficiency;
>
> Neither of envy; but of modesty
>
> These great professors often want a grain,
>
> Though they in others of this want complain;
>
> Their usual candour, if you've any doubt,
>
> You'll by this method very soon find out.
>
> Ask them what sort of teachers others be,
>
> If Mister A or B, or C or D,
>
> Are not good teachers? — this candid tribe will say,
>
> "These people have no talent to display;
>
> "A grovelling set, they never had repute,
>
> "Nor dare with us one moment to dispute".
>
> Or else pretend these teachers to disown,
>
> And say, "As masters they are quite unknown".
>
> Like rival ladies, run each other down,
>
> Rail at the taste and blindness of the town.
>
> Bel. Candor's a virtue that but few possess,
>
> Yet there's but few who candor don't profess.
>
> Jem. I've seen such tricks play off you'd scarce believe,
>
> By these quack teachers, aye, that would deceive
>
> Satan himself, who would scarcely be aware
>
> Of such finesse, but drop into their snare;
>
> They change their names, e'en country they disown.
>
> Bel. To me there's several of these gentry known,
>
> There's some to pass for foreigners will try,
>
> And on their impudence alone rely;
>
> They all declare they're lately come from France,
>
> And with them brought some new surprising dance;
>
> Yet many of them France have never seen,
>
> And others have to Calais only been.
>
> Others a letter from their names retrench,
>
> Or add, or else transpose to make it French;
>
> They shrug their shoulders, and cry "Sacre Dieu",
>
> But know no more of French than our Sue;
>
> They gabble broken French, and try to pass
>
> For Frenchmen; but are often like the ass
>
> In fable told, who wore the lion's skin,
>
> And strove to take his fellow-creatures in;
>
> Was by his ears at last found out, and then
>
> Was scouted and disgraced by beasts and men.
>
> Jem. That's just the case, Belinda, I well know,
>
> And can the truth of your assertions show;
>
> I heard a jabbering coxcomb once affect
>
> To understand and speak French dialect;
>
> Nothing you ever heard was so absurd,
>
> He misapplied and wrong pronounced each word;
>
> With nasal twang I head this creature call,
>
> The quadrille figures at his last grand ball,
>
> "It was neither French nor English that I heard.
>
> But jargon quite nonsensically absurd,
>
> Shrugs and grimace he used at every word!
>
> Bel. I think I know him, but I cannot say,
>
> So many new ones spring up every day.
>
> Jem. In almost every street are dancing rooms.
>
> And teachers now spring up like mushrooms,
>
> From clowns, fiddlers, hawkers, hucksters, tailors,
>
> Carpenters, cobblers, pantaloons, and sailors;
>
> From servants, tinkers, pastry cooks, and bakers;
>
> And some, I am told, were lately undertakers;
>
> They are all at once great adepts in the art,
>
> And promise rare instructions to impart;
>
> When they commence, with hopes to stamp their fame,
>
> They always add "professor" to their name,
>
> And then send out a pompous bill of fare,
>
> Contrived to make good honest people stare;
>
> Name every dance of which they've ever heard,
>
> Famed teachers bills they copy word for word;
>
> Not matter only but the type's the same,
>
> In nothing differ; but the teacher's name.
>
> Read but their bills, you'll find they promise all,
>
> That can be done by Vestris or by Paul.
>
> Bel. Don't they to able teachers often go,
>
> To learn of them what they pretend to know?
>
> Jem. A visit to their balls they sometimes make,
>
> And there a sort of outline strive to take,
>
> Of certain dances that they advertise,
>
> That never before met those professors eyes;
>
> And what's still more, they canvass while they're there,
>
> For their own balls, and give out bills of fare;
>
> For you must know they all have bails that they
>
> In print their names and talents may display,
>
> But never mean one twentieth part they say.
>
> Bel. Some knowledge of their balls I wish to gain.
>
> Jem. It would be digressing should I here explain,
>
> But I will soon their nature fully state,
>
> And likewise public bahs investigate;
>
> At present will confine myself to give
>
> You some idea how these quack teachers live,
>
> How great professors pupils do obtain,
>
> And how they oft instructions from them gain;
>
> When they get pupils who before were taught,
>
> And who, with them, have any dancing brought,
>
> From such they learn; what they never knew before,
>
> Although they've advertised it over and over.
>
> If pupils badly dance, or from neglect,
>
> Or want of genius, or can't recollect
>
> What they've been taught, professors lay the blame
>
> On former masters, to traduce their fame,
>
> And often boast from other teachers they
>
> Get pupils, but how they never fairly say;
>
> Whether from ignorance, or through some dispute,
>
> Or prices, which all pockets do not suit.
>
> One prides himself on what you'd scarce suppose,
>
> That he the manners of a dustman knows;
>
> To show his predilection for that trade,
>
> Has had his portrait as a dustman made,
>
> Which in his ball-room is conspicuous placed,
>
> To show his pupils his fine attic taste.
>
> Heed be offended, should he hear you say,
>
> He is not the greatest dustman of the day.
>
> Bel. Such vulgar notions in a teacher show
>
> That his connections must be very low;
>
> What sort of people visit at his place?
>
> Are all his pupils of the dusting race?
>
> You know the saying is, "birds of a feather
>
> (Be what they may) will always flock together".
>
> Example in the master leads the van;
>
> As acts the master, mostly acts the man;
>
> Yet, who and what they are, I never heard.
>
> Jem. They, are all gentlemen, if you will take his word.
>
> Bel. So he will say, but did you ever hear,
>
> A silken purse was made from a sow's ear?
>
> Jem. Though he has professed the art for several years,
>
> The dustman in his dancing still appears.
>
> The dancing dustman, some have called this wight,
>
> And those, who know him, say they've named him right;
>
> He teaches all departments of the art,
>
> And promises the Graces to impart.
>
> Bel. It is strange, if those in Graces can excel,
>
> Whose motto is, "the basket and the bell".
>
> Dustman and dancing master most folks say,
>
> Are callings opposite, as night from day.
>
> Is it from ignorance, or for gain, that he
>
> Delights in this strange low propensity?
>
> Jem. It must be gain, though every one agrees:
>
> He is really not a modern Socrates;
>
> Yet such a stickler for the trade he's grown,
>
> He'll own himself inferior to none.
>
> Bel. The dancing masters hardly will dispute,
>
> That he is not a dustman of repute,
>
> Nor envy him his portrait or his fame,
>
> Nor "Dusty Bob", should he prefer that name;
>
> May he enjoy the basket and the bell,
>
> And every dustman in the town excel!
>
> Jem. Another teacher thinks he shows his skill,
>
> Who makes his placard like a lottery bill;
>
> The leading features of his bill you'll see,
>
> With lottery puffing strictly will agree:
>
> He prints (in letters nearly one foot high)
>
> The following puff, designed to catch the eye.
>
> "Quadrilles by him are in six lessons taught",
>
> With this he hopes the public will be caught.
>
> But, note his hill, you in small type will find,
>
> He has a saving clause, secure behind,
>
> Like haberdashers, who write up "as Todds",
>
> Where the conjunction "as" makes all the odds:
>
> His bill not only this device displays,
>
> But to its author gives the greatest praise.
>
> For his acquirements, and his matchless skill,
>
> "To name them all, requires a larger bill".
>
> Bel. These lottery-puffing teachers will no doubt,
>
> Soon, like the lottery, puff themselves quite out.
>
> Jem. Their loss to London this effect will have,
>
> The public will both time and money save.
>
> Another "secret graces can impart",
>
> "That few or none can analyse his art";
>
> "How its created, common teachers are"
>
> "Quite ignorant"; — thus runs his bill of fare.
>
> Another plan these petty teachers try,
>
> To pick up pupils from the passers by,
>
> By opening wide the windows where they sit,
>
> Scraping aloud some fiddle, bass, or kit,
>
> Just to collect a crowd about the door,
>
> To gape up at the first or second floor;
>
> To make themselves and residence well known,
>
> Is what they have in view and what they own;
>
> They have no regard for strict propriety,
>
> Their only aim is notoriety;
>
> Walk in who will, they're never very nice,
>
> And seldom differ with you as to price;
>
> To take your money they are always willing,
>
> They let none go who will advance one shilling.
>
> Bel. That's true enough, for I have heard it said,
>
> Aye, fifty times, by many who have paid;
>
> Yet, these quack teachers oft a consequence
>
> Assume, to which they've not the least pretence,
>
> Either in means, manners, or in sense.
>
> Jem. To gain a consequence these teachers try,
>
> And either on their impudence rely,
>
> Or some device or singularity,
>
> In hopes of fame or popularity.
>
> Another thinks that Royalty has charms,
>
> And on his shutters paints the Royal Arms;
>
> But e'er to see the Royal Guest dance there,
>
> Credulity itself would even despair.
>
> Bel. Perhaps he to the palace often goes,
>
> To drill the monarch and to point his toes.
>
> Jem. He, at the royal residence, it is said,
>
> Was never seen — to knock would be afraid,
>
> Lest the rude porter in an angry fit,
>
> Should feel his ears, and tread upon his kit,
>
> And make him soon be glad to stir his stumps,
>
> Through mud and water in his dancing pumps.
>
> Bel. And yet, perhaps, that lady who of late,
>
> Has claimed the honour of the Royal state,
>
> (For whom some people Acheron would move
>
> If they should fail to bend the Gods above),
>
> May have beheld with her discerning eyes,
>
> The great professor's modest merit rise,
>
> And granted licence which must all surprise.
>
> Jem. If, it is not so, he must, to escape disgrace,
>
> Just take a mop and smudge his lion's face.
>
> The same professor says, (though I've not seen),
>
> He has invented a rare new machine,
>
> To teach the waltz without a master's aid,
>
> And with it he has several waltzes made.
>
> Bel. Well; after this, there's nothing strange can seem,
>
> We next shall hear that people waltz by steam.
>
> Jem. But I have not all its properties explained,
>
> As other great advantages are gained;
>
> He says it will make deformity quite straight,
>
> And awkward persons have a genteel gait;
>
> Like smiths, who can the heated iron with ease
>
> Extend, straighten, or bend how they please;
>
> However stiff deformed or old they have been,
>
> They all waltz gracefully by this machine.
>
> Another modestly a Latin motto tries,
>
> None less than Nelson's his great mind supplies.
>
> "Palmam qui meruit ferat", he cries.
>
> Bel. This really is what mottoes ought to be.
>
> Jem. Yet, with this motto, he didn't long agree,
>
> But fearing it was really verified,
>
> As he no pupils got, he shortly tried
>
> To make himself more singular, then chose
>
> To hoist a flag as at a rendezvous;
>
> These banners from the windows he let fly,
>
> With large inscriptions meant to catch the eye;
>
> His name, profession, and the terms you'll find,
>
> With strange devices on these flags combined.
>
> Others, quack doctors like, aspire to fame,
>
> And give their portrait to preserve their name.
>
> They all are gentlemen, at least if they
>
> Tell true, and you'll believe in what they say.
>
> Another great professor still goes higher,
>
> Who always writes and stiles himself "Esquire",
>

>
> There's some professors to acquire a name.
>
> On able teachers merits build their fame
>
> From skilful teachers, pupils they engage,

>
> The royal arms now most professors sport,

>

>
> Jem. These teachers have another trick, which they
>
> Upon inquiring strangers often play:
>
> They purchase worn-out shoes of every kind,
>
> And save all those their pupils leave behind,
>
> Put them in heaps; or place them in a row,
>

> Of business: ask them what pupils they
>
> Have got; they pointing to the shoes will say,
>
> "Here, count their feet, you see I have a few
>
> "Who practice hard; those shoes were lately new".
>
> To find their wearers you would have no chance,
>
> They are either dead, or have long ceased to dance.
>
> Bel. I've seen this trick played off, by one you know,
>
> Who only first commenced three months ago,
>
> Jem. To pass for what they're not is their intent,
>
> But nothing do without a precedent;
>
> One step alone these teachers dare not go,
>
> As they have no genius of their own to show,
>
> But wait till others publish something new,
>
> Then word for word, and step for step pursue;
>
> They on those masters must attendance dance;
>
> They follow close, but dare not one step-advance;
>
> They send forth works on dancing stole from those
>
> They imitate, and strenuously oppose;
>
> To hide their thefts, they change the form and stile
>
> Of the original, their readers to beguile,
>
> Transpose the matter, to evade the law,
>
> If sued for plagiarism, to find a flaw.
>
> From books and bills these teachers feel no shame
>
> To copy all, except the author's name.
>
> But have not conscience to admit the same;
>
> Like hardened thieves, the truth they will conceal,
>
> And only at the rack, own what they steal,
>
> They prior dates and borrowed titles try,
>

>
> If you examine what these poachers claim,
>
> You'll find the author bear another name,
>
> Yet blacking-makers like, bid you beware,
>
> Of imitators, and of spurious ware;
>
> From Day and Martin they their cautions take,
>
> Though trite, they hope they may impression make;
>
> Like Warren and Dyson, these professors cry,
>
> "Be sure you ask for — when you buy".
>
> Comparisons are sometimes odious found,
>
> So these professors their own trumpet sound;
>
> To puff themselves these teachers feel no shame,
>
> So recommend whatever bears their name,
>
> And slander all of whom they've ever heard,
>

> In bills and puffs they all devices try,
>
> And print in red and blue to catch the eye:
>
> In hucksters shops, on walls, and posts you find,
>
> Their spacious bills of fare of every kind;
>
> They think if they could echo through the town
>
> Their names, it would stamp them teachers of renown.
>
> Bel. I've often heard what there's no room to doubt,
>
> The greatest blockhead makes the greatest rout,
>
> And by his noise the fool is oft found out.
>
> Jem. I hope that may occur to those
>

>
> And save the public from those great impostors,
>
> Who only bear the name of dancing masters;
>
> Hoping with consequence their names to grace,
>
> They oft before them several initials place,
>
> As G. M. S. and R. M. D.; likewise
>
> Three notes of admiration meet your eyes,
>
> Just like a Spanish prince, of whom I've heard,
>
> Who had fifty names most pompous and absurd;
>
> Their egotism is visible to all,
>
> For every thing by their own names they call,
>
> The dances, steps, and tunes, they always name
>
> From their dear selves, for to preserve their fame;
>
> Some make low terms, and think they'll numbers gain,
>
> Others strive hard, high prices to obtain,
>
> And think the price will show the teacher's fame,
>
> And 'mongst the great, disseminate his name;
>
> It is not the money they extort alone,
>
> From pupils I complain of, but you must own,
>
> They teach them methods which can't be removed;
>

>

>
> Another system they pursue for gain,

>
> Apprentices, with premiums, and engage
>

>
> Though they've no talent to fulfil the task
>

>
> They're silly elves who think they will recover;
>
> When fools bethink themselves, the market's over.
>
> Refunding is what these teachers don't profess,
>
> That is a virtue which but few possess;

>
> Strangers mistake, for great professors, now
>

>
> An instance of it shall be plainly shown,

>
> When he forgetting etiquette and grace,
>
> Was by the master kicked from out the place;
>
> It was not in motions, graceful, soft, and slow,
>
> Performed, as Vestris would have raised his toe;
>
> These movements were not in the waving line,
>
> Of beauty, gentle, soft, and serpentine;
>
> For they not only wanted ease and grace,
>
> But were applied all to a nameless place;
>
> No stings of conscience did the sutler feel,
>
> Though the professor cried — "it was ungenteel":
>
> The cause was this, so void of grace was he,
>
> He dared insult a lady while at tea;
>
> Remonstrance was in vain, he bounced and swore,
>

>
> The fiddlers laughed at his disgrace with all.
>
> That had assembled at this shilling ball:
>
> To know his name, inquiry went about,

>
> Bel. I heard some persons once this tale relate,
>
> But really thought they did exaggerate.
>
> Jem. It is true, depend on it, for it came to me,
>
> From one that played there, who the whole did see;
>
> Yet this professor teaches, as I'm told,
>
> This polite art to young and sometimes old;
>
> But read his bills, and see what there's professed,
>
> And if you knew what dancing he possessed,
>
> A great professor is easy made, you'd own,
>
> For he's one made by impudence alone.
>
> Bel. What sort of people go to this strange clown?
>
> They must be fools, and strangers to the town;
>
> Like the good neighbours in Ben Jonson's play,
>
> They scarce know what they hear, or see, or say.
>
> Jem. There's some of each no doubt with others blended,
>
> Who are grown too old in folly to be mended;
>
> And many instances of this appears,
>
> As wisdom sometimes don't keep pace with years.
>
> Bel. How can he find so many fools to go,
>
> To learn of one who does so little know?
>
> Jem. There's fools in plenty in the town they say,
>
> And fresh cart loads to town come every day.
>
> These teachers fish for fools, for all agree,
>
> That fools believe in all they hear or see.
>
> Bel. Those we call fools, if asked, no doubt, will say,
>
> That we are now much greater fools than they;
>
> For self-opinion with our pride combined,
>
> Too often makes us to our interest blind;
>
> Of want of judgement, few themselves suspect,
>
> And our own errors we too late detect.
>
> Jem. That's true, no doubt, but nature has, you'll find,
>
> To our own faults made us completely blind;
>
> For nature plants in every human breast,
>
> A notion they are wiser than the rest;
>
> Each calls his neighbour fool, but will not own,
>
> That he, himself, is dull or stupid grown:
>
> The sorriest sots, nay, the most abject tools,
>
> Will often call the privy council fools.
>
> No mortal can be found, however dull,
>
> That will admit he has an empty scull.
>
> Bel. To every rule exceptions do abound,
>
> And in opinion there's great difference found;
>
> For some would venture where a saint would dread.
>
> Jem. Yes; "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread";
>
> These are the guests these teachers strive to gain,
>
> Who may be cheated, and will not complain;
>
> They send their schemes, their puffs, and bills of fare,
>
> Throughout the town, north, east; nay, every where.
>
> Some to the public papers are confined,
>
> But they are puffers of the self same kind;
>
> Their terms are low — a week some say is all
>
> You need attend, to fit yon for a ball.
>
> Others more bold, who, "in three lessons" say
>
> They'll make a novice dance and grace display,
>
> Kind, clever souls! to save our time and purses!
>
> Bel. You mean such quacks well merit kicks and curses.
>
> Jem. some go to those who most professions make;
>
> These teachers first do this, the money take;
>
> When that's received, their pupils soon discern,
>
> More money's wanted if they mean to learn:
>
> Should they refuse, and say they're taken in,
>
> Still fresh believers come, and there begin;
>
> However, dull, these teachers all agree,
>
> In any dance you shall completed be,
>
> And for one guinea only, that is all,
>
> You need expend to fit you for a ball;
>
> Should you have doubts, and say, great time it would take
>
> Before you could a graceful dancer make;
>
> To sooth your fears these teachers will foretell,
>
> (Even to a minute) when you shall dance well;
>
> They name what lessons pupils ought to take,
>
> Engage that number will good dancers make;
>
> (And what's more cheering) they the number fix,
>
> And for completion, too! and that's but six!
>
> It, matter not who goes, the same they're told,
>
> Should they be either stupid, stiff, or old.
>
> Bel , Those with six lessons, every one must own,
>
> Are only fit to jump about alone;
>
> For should they e'er to public dances go,
>
> They must make sport for those who dancing know;
>
> I have known some persons fifty lessons take;
>
> Who even then did sorry dancers make;
>
> When pupils have six lessons had do they,
>
> Engage again, or do they go away?
>
> Jem. Some in those lessons find they have been cheated,
>
> As with six lessons they are not half completed.
>
> Bel. What, says the master, when they plainly show,
>
> They've had six lessons and the dance don't know?
>
> Jem. These great professors then to save their fame,
>
> Will on their pupils always lay the blame;
>
> "Then you must have another course (they say),
>
> Or else your time and money's thrown away.
>
> It is found these courses oft must be repeated,
>
> Before the pupils in the dance completed;
>
> Experience then will whisper in their ear,
>
> That in the end they have bought cheap dancing dear.
>
> Bel. Surely completion means when you well know,
>
> The dance you're learning, and can plainly show,
>
> That you the steps and figures well combine;
>
> Can execute and show the whole design;
>
> Till then, and not till then, can pupils be
>
> Completed does their completion then agree
>
> With this? have pupils, too, the privilege shown
>
> To practice, till their dances are well known?
>
> Jem. That is a privilege quite to them unknown.
>
> Bel. Then when completions urged, pray, what defence
>
> Have these professors, and what's their pretence?
>
> Jem. They blame the pupils, say, "they've hundreds taught,
>
> And in six lessons to perfection brought";
>
> In fact, their methods never fail, when they
>
> (The pupils) practice, and attention pay:
>
> They'd mention pupils names, if, you insisted,
>
> As living proofs (who never yet existed).
>
> Completion's by them managed in this way,
>
> Beyond six lessons you again must pay;
>
> They, by this practice, many guineas gain,
>
> Which by fair dealings, they would never obtain.
>
> Bel. What plan, what means, do these quack teachers try,
>
> When they at first commence how do they supply
>
> Their rooms with company, as they're unknown,
>
> And have no reputation with the town?
>
> Jem. To fill their rooms and make a specious show.
>
> They tickets send to all the girls they know;
>
> Which will admit as many ladies more,
>
> As choose to come, should it be half a score!
>
> Welcome are all who come, there's no selection
>
> For character, for morals, or connection;
>
> As these are little niceties which they
>
> Don't mind. Girls they must have, for girls they say,
>
> Will men entice, and likewise make them stay;
>
> It is men that they make pay, ladies they know
>
> To balls without their purses often go.
>
> With this in view, these teachers one and all,
>
> Do visit every hop or public ball;
>
> And tickets give to girls of every sort,
>
> Who usually to common hops resort,
>
> For they admit of guests of every, kind.
>
> Bel. Then that explains how they such numbers find.
>
> Jem. They all know well that human nature's frail,
>
> And of her weakness do themselves avail;
>
> That every one will at new conquests aim,
>
> To feed their passion, or extend their fame:
>
> Though often jilted, and though they complain
>
> Of broken vows, yet still they'll try again.
>
> Each sex, by turns, preponderates (they find),
>
> Each has attractions of a different kind:
>
> Sometimes the gentlemen attractive prove,
>
> Sometimes the ladies have the power to move
>
> The gentlemen for interest, or for love:
>
> It is known each have magnetic powers, which they
>
> As suits their purposes bring into play;
>
> That either interest or inclination
>
> Is prominent in every rank and station;
>
> For many a man to meet a girl will go
>
> To balls; and girls in hopes to gain a beau,
>
> And this these teachers by experience know;
>
> Besides, that dancing's a pretext to see
>
> The favourite Mister A----------, or else Miss B----------,
>
> These rooms are places made for assignation.
>
> Bel. To see it wants but little penetration,
>
> I wish to know when schools they chance to gain,
>
> How these quack teachers there themselves maintain.
>
> Jem. When they teach schools, which sometimes is the case,
>
> The school as well as pupils they disgrace,
>
> By teaching what they'd be ashamed to show,
>
> If they did well the art of dancing know.
>
> Bel. How do such teachers e'er get boarding schools,
>
> As they are seldom kept by simple fools?
>
> But well experienced persons who have seen,
>
> The world, and some have dancing-teachers been.
>
> Jem. These teachers on expedients all rely,
>
> And oft successfully this project try,
>
> They hire a chaise and servant for the day,
>
> And never fail a livery to display;
>
> Then drive to every school around the town,
>
> And give out cards as teachers of renown;
>
> To pass for masters who've acquired some fame,
>
> They often change, and so transpose their name;
>
> To point on it who they are by their address,
>
> Some secret magic power you must possess;
>
> If they're employed it is ten to one the case,
>
> But their exposure prove the schools disgrace;

>

>
> The difference is as great, say what you please
>
> You can't be wrong, if you say "chalk to cheese";
>
> Yet they to schools and families will go,

>
> Long credit too, they know will oft prevail,
>
> Where talent and where genius often fail:
>
> These are proposals which these teachers make:
>
> With these inducements schools for interest sake
>
> Oft change their masters, and their schools disgrace,
>
> By giving quacks an able teacher's place:

>
> Jem. What most digressors do, I've oft heard say.
>

>
> They may be trifles, but perhaps you'll say,
>
> They're not those trifles we should throw away.
>
> To other plans this project some will join,

>
> May make the wearer for a bottle pay;

> Establish fines, but place the cautions where
>
> They can't be seen, to catch you in a snare.
>
> Bel. These practices are pitiful and mean,
>
> And in the ball-room never should be seen;
>
> Are only fit for public houses, where
>
> The lowest sots the lowest habits share.
>
> Jem. One, showman like, with challenges abounds,
>
> "Will dance a hornpipe for a hundred pounds",
>
> With any one who dare contest his skill.
>
> Bel. I have read professor's challenge in his bill.
>
> Jem. This great professor, any one would swear,
>
> Has copied Saunders at Bartholomew fair;
>
> Or from some fire-eater stole his plan,
>
> Or mountebank, or hocus-pocus man,
>
> Who all give challenges on which they'd bet,
>
> The sum's no matter, say, the national debt;
>
> For these buffoons know, when the bet's proposed,
>
> They run but little risk of being opposed;
>
> And should that happen, as perhaps it may,
>
> Then comes the rub, how can you make them pay?
>
> For who would wager with a mail of straw,
>
> Too slippery to be held by any law;
>
> But surely the professor never reflected,
>
> When he this showman's trite device selected.
>
> Forgot that any reputable man,
>
> Would be ashamed to act upon this plan.
>
> Professor must to erase this stigma go,
>
> To prove he never dances at a show;
>
> Quack doctor like, to mansion-house to swear
>
> "That he is not a dancer at a fair";
>
> Fifty professors he invokes to see
>
> His matchless prowess and great ability.
>
> To show the town they'll have a monstrous treat,
>
> "His bill of fare's to measure full nine feet".
>
> Like strolling hucksters who, to make you buy
>
> Their damaged ware, "good lumping pennyworth's" cry;
>
> This sage professor puffs himself so well,
>
> No bottle conjurer can't him excel.
>
> Bel. Whatever he says, from this there's no retreating,
>
> Folks always prove the pudding by the eating;
>
> This tap-room challenger I hope will see
>
> The folly of his inconsistency,
>
> And leave long bills and challenges to those
>
> Shameless buffoons you see at penny shows;
>
> To those who read, this may, like Turner's blacking,
>
> Reflect professor's face, and cure his cracking.
>
> Another dancing anecdote I've heard,
>
> Which, although true, is equally absurd;
>
> It is of a great professor, that's well known,
>
> Who stiles himself inferior to none;
>
> Yet, if a stranger come, who can dance well,
>
> Professor, for this crime, would him expel.
>
> Bel. Ability, a crime by whom recorded?
>
> Talent, I have heard, should always be rewarded.
>

>
> Jem. I'll tell you as I heard it, word for word,
>

>
> To make amends, he on a project hit,
>
> Though old and trite it savoured of his wit;
>
> So hailed the thought, and cried — "this scheme will fit".

>
> For abstinence is not the guiding star,
>
> That's worshipped now eastward of Temple Bar;
>
> From this he augured that a specious bill,

> Those guests, who had, not read his bill with care.
>
> And who thought they gratis should a supper share,

> Care's not if he's consistent in his phrase,

> Nor if his ball keep pace with what he says;
>
> Like some professors who, to make a bounce,
>
> Instead of ball, a carnival announce.
>
> Their carnival like our professor's treat,
>
> Proves just the same in substance, a grand cheat.
>
> The master of the ceremonies, I am told,
>
> At this grand fête was only seven years old.
>
> Bel. A child, of seven years old, that's very strange!
>
> A child appointed dancing to arrange!
>
> I have heard of lord's and bishops of that age,
>
> But not directors for the ball or stage;
>
> Professor's motives I've not heard you state,
>
> Did it from vanity originate?
>
> Jem. Whether from vanity, or for gain alone,
>

>
> Professor's motives I have never heard.
>
> Bel. Whatever the motives were, the things absurd,
>
> Does he the duties of that office know?
>

>
> Jem. I am told professor did with care impart,

> A learner soon would know as much as he;
>
> If they tell true, whatever he may say,

>
> Jem. Another teacher who for years I've known,

>
> Has imitated those I've just exposed,
>

> How could he e'er such vulgar notions know,
>
> For he's above a dancer at a show.
>
> Sure, our professor, if he had reflected.
>

>

>
> "Sleep with the dogs and you must rise with fleas".
>
> However foolish be the thing, some zany
>
> Will do the like, and thus one fool makes many.
>
> For many fools will every hazard run,
>
> And never think until the deed is done.
>
> Bel. I have been told he has been heard to say,
>
> He cannot live in any other way.
>
> If that's the case, he never must complain,
>
> But be contented in Duke's Place to reign.
>
> Jem. This showman's practice, though extended far,
>
> Has not, thank Heaven, reached west of Temple Bar.
>
> Bel. May these professors never west he seen,
>
> But in the east for life do quarantine,
>
> And keep such vulgar notions to amuse.
>
> Butchers, sailors, wapping girls, and Jews.
>
> Jem. One thought heed something monstrous advertise,
>
> That should at once the gaping town surprise,
>
> But never reflected on what there is no doubt,
>
> That fools, like cats: are by their noise found out;

>
> Many believed these fifty-two divisions,

>
> Yet I have heard professor oft advancing,
>
> Something about "philosophy of dancing".
>
> Perhaps he means to view with Boyle and Locke,
>

>
> Bel. Credulity, itself, this thought would shock;
>
> For would you judge his knowledge by his phiz
>
> On old Lavater's rules; but I'll not quiz:
>
> You'd say that if in print his work is found,

>
> And ten will reason wrong to one that's right;
>
> Sometimes the most absurd and trifling thing,
>

>
> For, like old Shandy some philosophize

>

>
> So he began to strain himself, and tried
>
> To stretch his skin, so burst himself and died.
>
> Let those who're in a hurry to be great,
>

> By this lives many a modern dancing master.
>
> Great actions do not always emanate
>
> From all who are called great men, as I can state;
>
> Nor do great places always make great men,
>
> As I could instance to you where and when,

### Enter Lucy.

> Lucy. Ladies, a gentleman has just come in,
>
> He asked, "Who's here, and when we should begin".
>
> Bel. Who can he be? Don't you his person know?
>
> Lucy. He's strange to me; perhaps this card will show (Producing a card).
>
> His name, and residence, and business tell,
>
> It from his pocket accidentally fell;
>
> He swore he to his skin was quite wet through,
>
> Shrugged up his shoulders, and cried "Sacre Dieu".
>
> Bel. Some Frenchman by his shrugs and exclamation.
>
> Jem. But our quack teachers imitate that nation,
>
> In manners, dialect, and action too,
>
> And all their curses end with "Sacre Dieu".
>
> Bel. Come, let me look, who this fine spark can be. (Looking at the cards).

### Exit Lucy.

> Ha! ha! it is one who always speaks to me,
>
> A quack professor, as you soon shall see,
>
> It is that pragmatic Chassée, a disgrace
>
> To dancing masters, and to every place
>
> Where ever he presumes to show his face;
>
> He only comes, I am certain with this view,
>
> To give out cards, or to learn something new
>
> He's proud, affected, and a downright fop,
>
> And talks in technic phrases of his shop,
>
> Shrugs and grimaces like the fops of France,
>
> And calls himself "Un maitre de la danse".
>
> Though all assumption, knows no more than they
>
> Who go to learn, although he makes them pay.
>
> Jem. I have seen this coxcomb, but he knows me not,
>
> And to expose him, have just formed a plot;
>
> If you'll assist me, I'll this very night,
>
> Show this pretender in his real light.
>
> Bel. In his exposure I shall take delight.
>
> Jem. My plan is this, I must pretend to know
>
> Nothing of dancing; then get him to show
>
> His steps and stile; I then before his face
>
> The same will dance, and thereby him disgrace;
>
> His gait and manners I will show likewise,
>
> And all his borrowed steps will analyse,
>
> And so exposed him that he dare not stay,
>
> Though impudent I'll make him run away.

### Enter Mister Chassée. Belinda and Jemima walk up the stage.

> Chassée. Two ladies here! — Hey! — Who is that I see
>
> Disguised; it is like Belinda. It cannot be.

### Belinda and Jemima discover themselves.

> Bel. Miss Jemima, Sir. — Mister Chassée, whose fame
>
> You have no doubt heard full half the town proclaim.
>
> Chassée. G. M. S. Chassée now I print my name.
>
> Didn't I near Temple Bar Belinda meet?
>
> Bel. I really, Sir, didn't know you in the street,
>
> Your parson's hat and dress to me were new,
>
> And strange at first I could not believe it was you.
>
> Chassée. That dress and hat are all my own design,
>
> There's not another in the town like mine;
>
> That is a proof of my ability,
>
> My taste and my originality.
>
> Bel. You're known for taste and singularity;
>
> But, Mister Chassée, you really me surprise,
>
> To see you here I scarce believe my eyes.
>
> Chassée. Surprise is mutual, that I must confess,
>
> To see Belinda here in such a dress!
>
> Bel. I have motives for it, Sir. You must excuse
>
> Me now, as it would confidence abuse.
>
> Chassée. Pardon me, madam, I've no wish to pry
>
> Into your motives, that you may rely.
>
> Bel. Excuse me, now, perhaps before you go,
>
> You may the object of my visit know.
>
> My friend, this lady, hither came with me,
>
> Accidentally a maiden aunt to see,
>
> Who has apartments here: we stopped to tea:
>
> While we were chatting — chanced to call,
>
> And gave us each a ticket for the ball.
>
> If I may now presume, your business is,
>
> To show your stile, and our new dances quiz.
>
> Chassée. Their usual stile's, most wretched, you must say,
>
> Why my dog Towsor has more grace than they:
>
> They've nothing here but dances I well know,
>
> There's nothing new which they to me can show;
>
> For teachers one and all now come to me,
>
> When they the modern dances wish to see;
>
> Yet with assurance they will oft propose
>
> To teach, as theirs, the dances I compose.
>
> Bel. I hear that several of them copy you.
>
> Chassée. And by my merit live. Ah, Sacre Dieu!
>
> Bel. They say that you're a teacher of renown.
>
> Chassée. I'll challenge any master in the town,
>
> And dance with him in any dance he will
>
> Propose: a minuet, hornpipe, or quadrille.
>
> Bel. There's many dancers too of great repute.
>
> Chassée. With them for precedence I dare dispute.
>
> Bel. You ought to know the art, it is very plain,
>
> As you the technic terms of art explain.
>
> Chassée. I find you've read my bill by what you've said,
>
> In red and blue you'll see I've there displayed,
>
> The different things I teach, and likewise those
>
> Named by those teachers who my fame oppose:
>
> Mine is a kind of general depot
>
> For dances of all sorts, this the town well know,
>
> My bills and cards their names and prices show.
>
> Bel. Your bills I've often noticed on the wall,
>
> Contain strange dances, and if you teach all
>
> The odd new fangled things which you have named,
>
> No wonder that you've been so justly famed.
>
> Chassée. Trifles! mere trifles! I know ten times more,
>
> In my next bills you'll find I'll name a score,
>
> You've never heard of, nor have seen before.
>
> My cards and placards will my genius show,
>
> And tell to learners what they ought to know.
>
> These bills will show what teachers ought to be,
>
> This I'll assert, to which all must agree,
>
> None to perfection know the art but me;
>
> My bills contain more terms of art than you,
>
> Or any other person ever knew;
>
> And so arranged, there's not two lines alike,
>
> And all the leading features made to strike.
>
> Bel. You must allow a bill of fare's the least
>
> Substantial proof there will be a plenteous feast;
>
> It is not what's promised in a bill of fare
>
> That we commend, but viands we find there;
>
> The more there's said, the more the doubt's increased,
>
> The greatest promisers perform the least:
>
> It is so with many teachers, I well know,
>
> An instance of it I'll now plainly show.
>
> Chassée. Oh! wretches! true and palpable enough,
>
> Their bills are nothing but a glaring puff;
>
> Read them; mark well; you'll find them quite absurd,
>
> My bills, the wretches copy word for word:
>
> When I devise a bill that's something new,
>
> They imitate me, print in red and blue.
>
> For instance, see a bill of theirs; here's mine. (Produces bills).
>
> See how I'm imitated line by line;
>
> They're so alike, it is only in the name
>
> They're different: in fact, they seem the same.
>
> Bel. Such imitators should be brought to shame;
>
> I went to one that prints a flaming bill,
>
> And promises the items to fulfil,
>
> And dares all teachers to contest his skill;
>
> I took his bill with me, said, I'd contended,
>
> That he in dancing was what he pretended;
>
> Then from it chose some specimens to try,
>
> Whether I could upon his bill rely.
>
> The great professor in a passion flew,
>
> Took snuff, aped consequence, and cried "Sacre Dieu",
>
> Said I was sent by teachers he well knew.
>
> Not e'en one single dance could I obtain,
>
> No proof or satisfaction could I again,
>
> Although I urged his credit was at stake,
>
> He would not dance, but this excuse did make;
>
> First shrugged his shoulders, rubbed hid hands, then said,
>
> "That such a strange request was never made,
>
> Of him whose talent never was disputed,
>
> Nor such inquiries ever instituted";
>
> He said those dances which I had proposed,
>
> To him to dance, "were by himself composed,
>
> Which he would dance were he not indisposed".
>
> Thus boaster like, when driven the test,
>
> Excused himself from all he had professed.
>
> Chassée. A usual practice which these teachers use,
>
> To gull the town and confidence abuse.
>
> Bel. The bill I told him was as I expected,
>
> A puff, and he was what I had suspected,
>
> A boasting quack, as I had long supposed,
>
> Whose impositions ought to be exposed:
>
> He all confusion; nothing more could say,
>
> Turned on his heel, abruptly walked away.
>
> Just like the boasting traveller of old,
>
> (Whose story Æsop has in fable told),
>
> Who boasted he at Rhodes had often been,
>
> Had beat in leaping all he had ever seen.
>
> (It should be told the Rhodians all were famed
>
> For leaping, and this he likewise named)
>
> To make himself the more believed he swore,
>
> That all he said heed prove, and ten times more;
>
> But one, who was a Rhodian, rose and said,
>
> "I come from Rhodes, and now am not afraid,
>
> To try with you immediately and see,
>
> If you're the person you pretend to be".
>
> This struck the boaster dumb, he could not say
>
> A word, nor dare he try, but skulked away,
>
> Disgraced and shamed, as every boaster ought,
>
> When in such falsehoods and such boastings caught.
>
> Chassée. These quacks, I've challenged, aye, in every way,
>
> To dance with me, and their great skill display;
>
> They dare not answer me, but skulk away:
>
> Afraid to meet me, as you may suppose,
>
> These are the creatures, miss, who me oppose.
>
> Bel. Creatures, indeed! compared with those who know
>
> What dancing really is, and who can show
>
> They've execution, judgement, taste, and skill,
>
> And can their public promise well fulfil.
>
> A case in point their impudence will show,
>
> How they pretend to what they do not know;
>
> A friend told me (on whom I can rely),
>
> That she proposed a minuet to try,
>
> With one who prints "professor" in his bill,
>
> It was done to try the great professor's skill.
>
> With this proposal, he directly closed,
>
> And took his place to dance, as was proposed;
>
> But, strange! he knew the minuet no more,
>
> Than one who'd never seen the dance before,
>
> As he knew neither figures, steps, nor grace,
>
> For when he moved it was always out of place:
>
> His feet seemed quite confused, and not to know
>
> Which way to move, or where they ought to go:
>
> He watched his partner, scraped about the dance,
>
> And oft receded when he should advance:
>
> At length the lady, quite disgusted, cried,
>
> "I see this dance, sir, you've not lately tried";
>
> Then took her seat, and to herself exclaimed,
>
> "This to the public ought to be proclaimed".
>
> Chassée. These creatures I'd expose in every way,
>
> All these, I mean, who can't do what they say.
>
> Bel. And so would I. Excuse me, but I've heard,
>
> Something respecting you that has occurred,
>
> It was told to me by those well known to you.
>
> Chassée. The world's censorious! all we hear is not true.
>
> Bel. The other day I heard some persons state,
>
> That you've not opened your grand balls of late.
>
> Chassée. With opening dances I have been quite cloyed.
>
> Bel. I'm told at several you were much annoyed.
>
> Chassée. I must confess, at one some time ago,
>
> Some envious wretched teachers whom I know,
>
> Were rude enough to hiss, and to exclaim —
>
> "Observe, how shocking! — He pretend to fame!
>
> This proves he dancing only knows by name".
>
> With other libellous strange things that they
>
> Were base and impudent enough to say,
>
> Thus to asperse a gentleman who has been
>
> To France, a professor whose name is seen
>
> In every alley, corner, street or nook,
>
> And one who likewise lately made a book
>
> On dancing, which at once will show,
>
> That I the art must practically know.
>
> Were I not now a teacher of renown,
>
> This might do me an injury with the town.
>
> Bel. To some teachers, if such a thing took place,
>
> It would serious prove, and bring them to disgrace;
>
> But this and several circumstances more
>
> Of the same kind, I've heard you've had before;
>
> I mean the case that happened at that ball
>
> Of yours you held in the great hall;
>
> I cannot recollect the place or day,
>
> But it is the same you mean, from what you say:
>
> Pray let me hear from you how it occurred;
>
> No doubt but I've exaggerations heard.
>
> Chassée. Oh! oh! Mon Dieu! it is scandal every word,
>
> Perverted thus, for calumny to handle,
>
> We great professors are all born to scandal.
>
> The circumstance I'll on my honour state
>
> As it occurred, I cannot exaggerate.
>
> While opening with a fine specimen dance,
>
> Where I portrayed some dances de la France,
>
> My style and talents drew forth every praise,
>
> This did the envy of these teachers raise,
>
> To hiss and make a noise; for they confess,
>
> They dread the humble merit I possess;
>
> It raised their indignation thus to see,
>
> And hear such just applause bestowed on me.
>
> Bel. Was it applause from strangers or from friends?
>
> From whom or how it came so much depends.
>
> Chassée. It was alt from strangers, as I understand.
>
> My friends were neuter, didn't give a hand.
>
> Bel. It was very different as it was told to me.
>
> Chassée. Two of a trade you know can never agree.
>
> Bel. So I've been often told, and I presume,
>
> That you're the great professor you assume;
>
> There's something mere I heard the other night,
>
> If, it is misstated, you can set me right.
>
> Chassée. I am known for candour, no artifice conceal,
>
> Even my own faults and failings I reveal.
>
> Bel. Did you e'er join E. W. or Mister T.?
>
> Or e'er take lessons from a Mister B.?
>
> Chassée. What! I take lessons from a sorry crew.
>
> Who only copy me. — Oh! Sacre Dieu!
>
> With Norton or with Aldgate House you'll find,
>
> I have no connection, not of any kind;
>
> To be convinced, you my last bill should see,
>
> For there I've said these creatures copy me:
>
> I on myself alone rely for fame,
>
> Do not with puny teachers mix my name.
>
> Bel. Do you to J----------'s Well as usual go?
>
> And are you still with Mister H. in Co?
>
> Chassée. Sacre Dieu! I have cut the Tonsor long ago;
>
> Nor have I lately danced at J----------'s W----------ll
>
> As W----------r and the ---------- can tell.
>
> Bel. None can dispute such known veracity,
>
> So famed for virtue and sagacity;
>
> Now, if you'd dance a step or two to show,
>
> This lady your superior stile; I know
>
> If she approve, then, sir, she'll recommend.
>
> Jem. Real modest merit, I shall e'er befriend.
>
> Chassée. My modesty and merit, I presume,
>
> Are real; nothing false do I assume;
>
> Mine is the fashionable Stile you'll find,
>
> In which there,S grace and elegance combined;
>
> Here are some brilliant steps, I trust you'll say,
>
> Which grace and execution both display.

### Dances in a wretched and affected stile.

> Jem. That is a stile, indeed! These steps would be
>
> I fear too difficult to teach to me.
>
> Chassée. I made those steps myself, to me alone.
>
> These brilliant graceful steps are only known;
>
> I pledge myself my compositions are
>
> Original, with which none can compare.
>
> My dances will astonish, or I'm undone,
>
> Any lady or gentleman in London.
>
> I have a new method too, in which you'll find,
>
> All other teachers methods are combined.
>
> Bel. You've doubtless, many masters had, to show.
>
> You all these methods, likewise all you know.
>
> Chassée. My knowledge from instinct and real genius came,
>
> Not from such quacks as now aspire to fame.
>
> For all they know, I at one glance could take;
>
> My Towsor he could better dances make;
>
> These creatures can do little more than talk,
>
> Not one in ten know even how to walk;
>
> From me they copy all; to me they are
>
> Indebted, even for their bills of fare.
>
> Bel. Do you to their academies ever go?
>
> As you their stile of dancing seem to know.
>
> Chassée. I, from their pupils, who now come to me,
>
> Acquire their methods, and by this, you see,
>
> I all the knowledge of the town combine,
>
> With all those rare acquirements of mine
>
> For which I am known throughout the universe,
>
> And future ages will my praise rehearse;
>
> This causes teachers, who aspire to fame,
>
> To come to me to profit by my name.
>
> Bel. You must be skilled, why even your bill of fare,
>
> Contains such things, as makes most people stare.
>
> Chassée. I fifty dances teach, not mentioned there,
>
> Besides those composition of my own,
>
> Which are to the admiring town well known;
>
> I likewise have a new surprising dance,
>
> One which was lately brought to me from France;
>
> If at my salle de dance you'll honour me
>
> With your presence, those dances you shall see.
>
> Jem. You honour me, but, Sir, I must confess,
>
> I've really quite forgot your own address.
>
> Chassée. This card, Mademoiselle, does my address contain,
>
> And all the various dances will explain,
>
> Whether composed by me with those I teach,
>
> For general use, the term I give to each. (Presents card).
>
> Jem. Yours is a very handsome card address,
>
> The finest I have seen I must confess: —
>
> The arms, too! Well! really I am surprised!
>
> And then by royalty you're patronized.
>
> Chassée. I have that honour, and am proud to say
>
> I merit it: the reward's not thrown away:
>
> I trust my merit in quadrilles alone,
>
> Has made me to the dancing would well known.
>
> Bel. I've heard quadrilles are every night danced here,
>
> If so, I very awkward shall appear.
>
> Chassée. Do you know — La chaine des dames et chassée croisée,
>
> Chassée ouvert, queue du chat et balancez.
>
> Bel. I cannot say I understand them all,
>
> Although I danced them once at Almack's ball,
>
> I wish you would, sir, just perform L'été,
>
> And that will better put me in the way.
>
> Chassée. With pleasure, a quadrille I now will dance,
>
> With any in this country or in France.
>
> Bel. None can dispute it, sir, you're very kind.
>
> Chassée. This is the figure and the steps combined.

### Dances L’été. Belinda and Jemima laugh aside.

> Bel. Thank you, sir. Now, Jemima, try my dear!
>
> How you can do it, for you need not fear
>
> Mister Chassée; I'm sure, he will excuse your dancing.
>
> Come, Jemima, don't refuse.
>
> Chassée. Don't be afraid, miss. Come, now, let me see,
>
> It is not expected you should dance like me;
>
> From one, like you, miss, I cannot expect,
>
> Great execution, grace, or stage effect.
>
> In dancing, there's but very few excel;
>
> Bel. I've many teachers seen, who can't dance well.
>
> Chassée. Very true, miss, there's many great impostors,
>
> Who always call themselves great dancing masters.
>
> Bel. In their exposure, I should take delight,
>
> It would serve such barefaced gross impostors right.
>
> Chassée. If I could see them well exposed, it would be
>
> The greatest pleasure you could give to me.
>
> [To Jemima]. Now, try the dance, miss, do not hesitate,
>
> That you may learn it well, and imitate
>
> My grace and manners: I will once again
>
> Dance it over, it will make it clear and plain;
>
> Then, give me your, opinion, and observe,
>
> Speak what you really think without reserve.
>
> Jem. At your request I shall speak out my mind,
>
> A flatterer, sir, me, you'll never, find;
>
> For flattery often makes bad dancers vain.

Chassée. Don't flatter, me, for flattery I disdain.
>
> Jem. Of that you'll have no reason, to complain.

### Chassée dances; Jemima imitates.


> Chassée. That is the modern fashionable style;
>
> Now, miss, begin, I'll tune to you the while.

### Jemima dances; Chassée surprised and confused.

> Jem. Now, Sir, excuse the liberty I take,
>
> I've on your dancing some remarks to make,
>
> I'll stand corrected, if I cannot show,
>
> That something of the art I really know
>
> I've been at dancing since six years of age,
>
> And have for years had practice on the stage,
>
> From false positions all your steps you take;
>
> Third for fifth, and when the balloté you make,
>
> Your feet are so confined with turned up toes,
>
> That it is balloté, none could suppose;
>
> Your arms ungraceful then you bend your back
>
> And head, when dancing, like a half filled sack,
>
> You shake and wriggle, jerk about and swing,
>
> Like children's, puppets which they play with string;
>
> If such your manner, taste, and execution,
>
> Woe be to those who are under your tuition.

### Chassée walks about agitated taking snuff.

> Chassée. Mercy! here's scandal, you're employed by those,
>
> Poor envious teachers, who my fame oppose.
>
> Jem. And, likewise, sir, I've heard with some surprise,
>
> You can't perform one half you advertise;
>
> To prove it scandal, you, no doubt, will show,
>
> That, you these dances accurately know;
>
> Here, from your card, sir, now suppose we take, The first three dances, and a trial make.

### Takes out a card.

> Chassée. Madam! I'll stay no longer in this place,
>
> As your transcendent merit would disgrace,
>
> By daring a professor to impeach,
>
> To say that I can neither dance nor teach,
>
> Is quite libellous, and to my face, too,
>
> To name my faults, O! Sacre Dieu!
>
> How dare you, miss, such vague opinions give?
>
> Such, impudence I never will forgive.
>
> Jem. Now, pray, sir, stay, give us another dance,
>
> One of those novelties you had from France.

### Exit Chassée in a rage.

> Bel. Ha! ha! ha! I said you soon would-see,
>
> How well his words and actions do agree,
>
> He's a fair specimen of the same kind,
>
> Like him with ease I fifty more could find
>
> I wish they were exposed a little more.
>
> Jem. Of quacks, like these, I'd put to flight a score.
>
> There's one who keeps a gallimaufry hop,
>
> Thinks all his gagging brethren to overtop,
>
> Sends forth a bill of fare, "comme un François",
>
>
Not to bring folks to dance, but fools to pay.
>
> "Academic Royale" meets the wandering eye,
>
> And "Paris" stands in capitals just by.
>
> To read the wording of his bill of fare,
>
> You'd think it came from Vestris or Albert.
>
> But what surprise, when once you see the name —
>
> It is one who's long been kicked about by fame;
>
> Who has been treated like a common W----------,
>
> And, at Fame's temple, skulks about the door:
>

>
> What makes cats, and pigs run serpentine,

> Ask them why they have named them in this way?

>
> Who keep fools money for then, (so they, say),
>

>
> And make like fools, his cautious plans too late:

> Like some who caution never took before —
>
> When "dobbin's lost, they shut the stable door".
>
> Some blacking makers have their house in print,

>
> Have loaded porters is issuing from their floors,
>
> And ships seen freighting; to some distant shores
>
> Each from the print, hopes readers will infer,
>
> He Merchant is, and manufacturer.
>
> Traders, like dancers, will not hesitate
>
> To steal a name, or some one personate:
>
> You know the proverb we in Shakespeare read,
>
> "Who steals my purse makes-me quite poor indeed".
>
> When any one acquires great wealth or fame,
>
> Some imitator will assume the name
>
> Or else conceal his own, and only show
>
> The name he imitates, whom all well know,
>
> And paint it large to catch the passers by,
>
> And "as" or "from" too small to meet the eye,
>
> With this belief, hopes strangers will walk in,
>
> And think they deal with "Todd" not "Manikin";
>
> If you complain and prove you've been mistaken,
>
> They show the little "as" to save their bacon.
>
> In trades and callings, and in every art,
>
> They something new and wonderful impart:
>
> It is not to dancing only we're confined,
>
> But have strange projects now of every kind,

> E'en stones can't now lie quiet in the street,

> For they Mac Adamizing foes now meet;

> We hear of, and see daily advertising.
>
> Bel. Pray now inform me, is the reason known,

>

### Ball room dancers

> It is not those teachers only that I blame,
>
> But many private persons I could name.
>
> Who countenance such quacks, and aid their views.
>
> By which they public confidence abuse;
>
> Who know these teachers plans are to impose
>
> On all who in them confidence repose.
>
> Bel. Many who've been too obstinate to learn,
>
> Go to such teachers who can't faults discern,
>
> Or if they do, their interest you will find,
>
> To faults and errors, always makes them blind;
>
> Ability is not what they request —
>
> Pay the admission — you're a welcome guest
>
> To run, and kick, and flounce about at ease
>
> And make yourself as foolish as you, please;
>
> This they call "Dancing", and this, they say
>
> Is good amusement, and for this they pay.
>
> Jem. At some of their Great Balls", I have seen
>
> Such odd fantastic dancing, I have seen,
>
> That neither rule nor reason could devise,
>
> Such stuff as all good dancer's must surprise.
>
> Bel. There's persons that will any nonsense call
>
> Dancing, and every. petty hop "a ball".
>
> At these mock Balls, in the same dance you'll find,
>
> Styles of all sorts, and steps of every kind;
>
> They stamp and scrape, and kick about and scuffle —
>
> Some jump, some rap their heels, whilst others shuffle;
>
> Not two alike — you'd think them strangers hurled
>
> Together from all countries in the world.
>
> Jem. Call a quadrille, all scramble for a place,
>
> And few but would the post of honour grace,
>
> Perhaps I should say, would themselves disgrace.
>
> I've seen kind souls with wrinkles and grey hairs,
>
> Who couldn't so much as recollect their prayers,
>
> Presume to lead, and the quadrilles direct,
>
> Where thirty figures they should recollect;
>
> They've this advantage — as you mostly find
>
> In such formed sets, the blind there lead the blind.
>
> Bel. With such directors, I'm induced to ask,
>
> How do such dancers there perform their task?
>
> Call up a set — then each his book prepares,
>
> And cons his task, as children do their prayers;
>
> With book in hand, like boys called up to read,
>
> They stand and cut a sorry sight indeed;
>
> They reading stand, till half the strain is done,
>
> Then in their fright, like bunted rabbits run;
>
> And if by chance, they finish with the strain,
>
> In their confusion, lose the time again.
>
> I've oft observed that when the music stop,
>
> Some would-be Dancers, have not ceased to hop:
>
> Leaders should know the figures well by heart,
>
> And to the set correctly them impart.
>
> But I've seen those by whom the dance was led,
>
> Who have not had two figures in their head:
>
> Of those who take the lead, not one in twenty,
>
> Bat prove, When tried, their upper story's empty;
>
> Those horn book dancers, charitable elves,
>
> Will teach you what they do not know themselves;
>
> They misconstrue the technic terms of art,
>
> And read that wrong; which they should know by heart;
>
> Yet will advise, dictate — nay, some advance,
>
> That they've cut capers at the balls in France.
>
> Bel. How must good dancers laugh at such appeals,
>
> When they survey their sorry heads and heels;
>
> The old first set and Lancers, now is all
>
> You may expect danced at a public ball;
>
> Irish or Scotch in vain may be proposed,
>
> As what's not known is sure to be opposed;
>
> And if they're called, they're danced so very
>
> They run like pigs when drove against their will;
>
> Many from pride, won't own that they don't know,
>
> But headlong they in wrong directions go;
>
> They to the band for various sets will call,
>
> Yet dance the figures of the first to all:
>
> How this occurs, we have good reasons why,
>
> As they are all they know, and all they try.
>
> Jem. Dancing must now be certainly refined,
>
> For all have notions of a different kind:
>
> In the same dance, you'll scarcely ever see
>
> Two strangers dance whose stile at all agree;
>
> Some caper, others turn about like wheels,
>
> Some use their toes, and others trust to heels;
>
> Some drag their legs like cripples over the stones,
>
> Whilst others hop as if they'd broken bones
>
> Yet all will tell you they've been taught, and name
>
> Some great Professor, who aspires to fame,
>
> And seem unconscious that there ought to be,
>
> Either grace, science, or propriety:
>
> Should any dance be called, be what it will,
>
> A Spanish dance, a waltz, or a quadrille,
>
> Numbers stand up, and confidence will show,
>
> Though they the steps nor figures either know,
>
> If a quadrille, and some don't know the dance,
>
> To dance it right the others have no chance;
>
> For when the dance begins confusion rages,
>
> Aye, just like madness in its various stages.
>
> Some, lost in doubt, let all the time expire,
>
> Afraid to move, like horses at a fire;
>
> Others quite run, and often the wrong way,
>
> Neither for music nor their partners stay;
>
> Whilst others oft their folly to defend,
>
> Grow insolent, and for their rights contend;
>
> So blunder on, and spoil the figures quite,
>
> By being pushed and pulled to set them right,
>
> Till a quadrille looks like an Irish fight.
>
> Those who car dance, with indignation burn,
>
> And mutter out, "these people ought to learn".
>
> Bel. This to my mind does Pope's reflection bring,
>
> "A little learning, is a dangerous thing";
>
> It is so in dancing; those who little know,
>
> Expose themselves a consequence to show;
>
> Those who've no talent, or no steps to use,
>
> In others mostly excellence abuse,
>
> Declare that "they no inclination feel
>
> To dance with steps, for that is ungenteel".

Jem. This is a proof of ignorance you'll find,
>
> As fools hate science, aye, of every kind;
>
> But sometimes they from pride attempt to gain
>
> What they in others did as faults proclaim.
>
> Bel. Vanity in some's incurable, they say,
>
> For that commodity, fools dearly pay.
>
> Jem. You must allow, my dear, we all possess
>
> A share of vanity, some more, some less —
>
> If all were vain enough to strive to be
>
> A Vestris, or a Noblet, we then should see
>
> Some better dancers at our balls, than those
>
> Who now our general companies compose.
>
> The reason people dance so ill, I've stated,
>
> With teachers of the art originated.
>
> Bel. Teachers of dancing, say it to their shame,
>
> In their bad precepts have been most to blame
>
> For teachers should explain, and clearly show,
>
> That none should dance at balls, before they know
>
> Both steps and figures well, and can combine
>
> And make from them one perfect whole design:
>
> And these perform in time, with grace and ease,
>
> Which would the scientific artist please;
>
> These precepts should be clearly shown to all,
>
> As the perfections looked for at a ball;
>
> This is a duty that all teachers owe
>
> Their pupils, and this they really ought to know.
>
> Jem. This all good teachers know, but some you'll find,
>
> For interest, to their credit often blind
>
> For some will ask their pupils — one and all,
>
> To take a ticket, when they have a ball.
>
> No matter whether qualified or not,
>
> They there may dance, if something's to be got —
>
> Just how they please, their teacher won't complain,
>
> His object's not his credit, but his gain.
>
> This practice has of late so general grown,
>
> E'en some great teachers can't the charge disown;
>
> Upon this sanction many fools presume,
>
> They dancing know, and consequence assume:
>
> Dismiss their teachers, as these silly elves
>
> Think they've grown clever, and can teach themselves;
>
> Though they one perfect step can't even show,
>
> Or scarcely do the five positions know;
>
> Yet vainly think that they can dance as well,
>
> As many who in dancing do excel
>
> If they can through the figures go, they'll say,
>
> "I think I now can dance as well as they
>
> "Who've been two quarters; I'll no longer pay,
>
> "I can instruct myself — to balls I'll go,
>
> "And there pick up those figures I don't know".
>
> These are their notions, this is what they say,
>
> These are opinions uttered every day;
>
> I mean by those conceited silly guests,
>
> Who every public ball room now infest —
>
> Teachers have been encouragers, it is plain,
>
> Of all the innovations we complain;
>
> Who, in the end, will find out to their cost,
>
> They've with their credit, likewise pupils lost.

### Enter Lucy, with music book.

> Bel. Lucy! here, step this way! Is that the rain
>
> That rattles? — Hark! I hear it now quite plain.
>
> Lucy. It rains dreadfully! Why, it really pours: —
>
> I wouldn't to night a dog turn out of doors.
>
> The musicians are come in like drowning rats,
>
> The water ran in streams off both their hats.
>
> Bel. You'd better send them in, that we may hear
>
> What new quadrilles they generally play here.
>
> Lucy. They cannot come till they their clothes have dried,
>
> By getting wet, poor Mister Strummer died;
>
> He played in his wet clothes one night, I'm told,
>
> At Caper's ball, and died through getting cold;
>
> Alas! poor man! he often said, that he,
>
> When Mistress Strummer died, would marry me.
>
> Jem. Pho', never mind, if Mister Strummer's gone,
>
> I warrant you'll soon get as good a one;
>
> A girl like you will sweethearts have in plenty,
>
> Lucy. I'm told the loss of one's the gain of twenty.
>
> Jem. Lucy, now go and send the music in,
>
> They will amuse us till we can begin.
>
> Lucy. I'll send them in as soon as they have got
>
> Well dried, and had a drop of something hot. (Exit).

### On public balls

> Bel. We can't begin just yet, so pray, go on
>
> With the same subject we were last upon;
>
> Or else on public balls, for there's a field
>
> That will, I'm sure, a plenteous harvest yield.
>
> Jem. True, that's a subject which attention calls,
>
> I mean those various titled public balls;
>
> Which are so often advertised by those,
>
> Whose plan is on all strangers to impose
>
> Their schemes, by whom got up, of whom composed,
>
> I can explain, it is time they were exposed.
>
> It is not intended these remarks should be
>
> Applied to dancers of celebrity;
>
> But to pretenders who infest the town,
>
> And strive to pass for teachers of renown
>
> And others, whom I've known as fiddlers, waiters,
>
> Gallimaufry men, and undertakers
>
> And many others, who've no better claim —
>
> Yet in large placards, they grand balls proclaim;
>
> I've been to all that I've seen advertised,
>
> When I describe them, you will be surprised.
>
> Bel. Perhaps you're not aware that I have been
>
> Myself to several, and strange things have seen.
>
> Jem. Then you much better can appreciate,
>
> The truth of what I'm going to relate;
>
> And what escapes my notice, you must try
>
> To recollect, and all the chasms supply.
>
> Bel. I will with pleasure — that you may rely;
>
> I'm anxious now my dear to hear from you,
>
> Of all these balls, a full correct review.
>
> Jem. To all these various teachers' balls I've been;
>
> And all their tricks and stratagems have seen;
>
> I'll tell you briefly what they are, and give
>
> You information how these people live,
>
> Who hold such balls — they mostly do assume
>
> The names of teachers, and do oft presume
>
> To use great teachers' names, and say they've been
>
> Pupils, though they've such persons never seen;
>
> Or at some theatre of great renown,
>
> Declare they've danced, and thus they gull the town;
>
> Or, if they ever have been taught, you'll find
>
> It is hornpipes, reels, or dances of that kind.
>
> Or else a quarter's dancing at the most,
>
> Is all these great professors e'er can boast;
>
> Yet at their Balls they often advertise,
>
> Such strange anomalies, as must surprise
>
> All those who've etiquette and dancing seen,
>
> And at-well regulated balls have been.
>
> These teachers have no fame to lose, so they
>
> Care nothing what they either do or say;
>
> Should you enquire for items in their bill,
>
> And urge their public promise to fulfil;
>
> Then they excuse themselves, say what you name
>
> Cannot be done — they're either ill or lame.
>
> One tells the World his ball will be a treat,
>
> And in the gallery they may have a seat;
>
> But those who know him and his pupils, say
>
> They neither dancing, taste, nor grace display.
>
> Sometimes "Six harps, with two full bands" combined,
>
> Are leading features in their bill you'll find —
>
> If at a Tavern they should hold their ball,
>
> Tavern's the most conspicuous word of all;
>
> They on the place depend, not on their name,
>
> Thus strive to profit by the tavern's fame;
>
> They form the bills, the passers by to catch,
>
> Bel. And I know some that with them I can match;
>
> Have been myself by these delusions caught,
>
> And my experience I have dearly bought;
>
> At these pretended balls where I have been,
>
> I've never any thing like dancing seen;
>
> To see the minuet (that appropriate dance
>
> To open with) you never have a chance:
>
> Instead of which, a hornpipe, or a reel,
>
> Or else from mother Goose a dance they steal;
>
> By way of interlude, they often chase,
>
> To show their skill and their dear selves amuse,
>
> To dance in fetters, or in wooden shoes.
>
> Jem. At a grand ball, not far from Temple Bar,
>
> I saw some guests who did a minuet mar; v
>
> They scraped about, as children do at school,
>
> For bows, they bobbed, like dab chicks in a pool:
>
> Their arms when raised, how shall I them define?
>
> For even Euclid has no parallel line;
>
> Their fingers were devoid of grace and ease,
>
> And stiff, projecting like a chevaux de frieze;
>
> And their poor feet, for want of turning, went —
>
> I can't describe — and then their knees they bent.
>
> Whether from fear, or knowing all not right,
>
> They looked like hares, when started in a fright:
>
> And in the face, from doubt or some such cause,
>
> They seemed to merit pity, not applause.
>
> They raised their hats, not with a graceful ease
>
> That would a d'Egville, or a Vestris please;
>
> It was pure methodic, nothing like mishap,
>
> Just as a bear herd holds his cadging cap.
>
> They danced, not as our Shakespeare wished to see,
>
> To sink and rise like waving of the sea;
>
> For they the gentle waving line never used,
>
> But all the laws of art and grace abused.
>
> This surely is enough to make yon say,
>
> Let none dance minuets, who can't grace display.
>
> Their guests are mostly sorry sort of sparks,
>
> Composed of prentices, and barber's clerks,
>
> Who've never seen a ball; nor can they show,
>
> That they the manners of the ball room know;
>
> They've only been to hops, called balls by those
>
> Whose aim is on all parties to impose.
>
> At these grand balls I've seen strange people dance,
>
> Not quite au fait, as I have seen in France;
>
> But quite devoid of figures, steps, and grace,
>
> Who know not etiquette, their side, nor place
>
> Whose awkwardness was like, if I compare,
>
> A stupid bear herd, and his dancing bear.
>
> Jem. I've seen a self-taught beau, and his dear charmer,
>
> In dancing, look just like two hogs in armour;
>
> The holders of such Balls but seldom care,
>
> How awkward or how foolish guests appear.
>
> Such teachers say their companies they choose,
>
> "And Balls are quite select" — ye never refuse
>
> For pay, servants, apprentices, or peddling Jews;
>
> Take all who come, money's their only aim,
>
> They neither care for dancing, nor for fame;
>
> But should a dancer, or known teacher, call
>
> And ask of them admission to their ball,
>
> Heed be refused, for those imposing elves,
>
> Keep out all dancers better than themselves;
>
> They know comparisons would odious be,
>
> As their defects their guests would plainly see:
>
> If teachers come with tickets, they're abused,
>
> If they persist, they only get accused
>
> Of bringing tickets forged, or else they cry,
>
> "I've found you out, you come here as a spy";
>
> To justify themselves would be in vain,
>
> Abuse and scandal's all they would obtain.
>
> I know an instance where the like occurred,
>
> Where the professor to declare was heard,
>
> Heed let no dancers in, in any way,
>
> Whether they'd tickets, or proposed to pay.
>
> Bel. I know the man; and what you have related,
>
> Is strictly true, and not exaggerated.
>
> From pride and envy these quacks can't agree,
>
> Though all are of the same fraternity
>
> Though each would trick all those within their reach,
>
> They'd yet like thieves their brother rogues impeach;
>
> As traders who run down each other's shop,
>
> So dancers call each rival's ball, a hop.
>
> With envy they hypocrisy unite,
>
> And oft shake hands, when each from spleen coued fight;
>
> Will how at passing, and cry, how do you do?
>
> Though tacitly each other Sacre Dieu!
>
> Jem. To advertise new rooms, some feel no shame,
>
> Though they for thirty years have been the same.
>
> Bel. With some folks now, a handsome room is all
>
> The requisites they look for at a ball;
>
> Instead of dances, rooms they advertise,
>
> A chandelier the place of steps supplies.
>
> They've "Decorations" in a striking line,
>
> And with it "New embellishments" combine;
>
> Chassées nor coupées dare not show their face,
>
> Nor can you find one single line on grace:
>
> They always tell you, lest you should not hear,
>
> When they hang up a lamp or chandelier.
>
> E'en when they sweep the cobwebs with a broom,
>
> And every time they white-wash up their room,
>
> They advertise "their rooms done up anew",
>
> If only white-washed, that will prove it true.
>
> Though they themselves should wield the brush, they'll say
>
> It was done by some great artist of the day;
>
> Sometimes they tell you what the rooms have cost,
>
> And for your pleasure how much time they've lost;
>
> And that your comfort only is their care,
>
> And make their decorations bills of fare:
>
> Tell you of mirrors to reflect the face,
>
> But no reflections as to steps and grace;
>
> Mention the hundreds that their rooms will hold,
>
> Jem. Their numbers have too many O's I'm told.
>
> Bel. These modest souls in fiction like to frolic,
>
> And sometimes be a little hyperbolic;
>
> Just like some statesmen, who delight to vapour,
>
> And make a crooked line seem straight on paper.
>
> Therefore don't wonder, if these mean tacticians,
>
> Are not ashamed of such trite impositions.
>
> Bel. I've never heard, perhaps you can explain,
>
> How these ball holders do such numbers gain;
>
> To visit their grand balls, as it is well known,
>
> That most of them are to the town unknown.
>
> Jem. It is from good souls who've neither taste nor wit,
>
> Who think a teacher's bill's like holy writ;
>
> Who never reflect, but say as others say,
>
> And are by hearsay stories led away.
>
> Who've neither sense nor talent to dispute,
>
> Whom Nature's made a species of the brute:
>
> Such are their guests, and such these teachers suit.
>
> To pick up guests, our great professors go
>
> To every petty dance, hop, ball, or show;
>
> And there distribute bills and cards, to those
>
> Who do those motley companies compose.
>
> In booths at fairs, they've canvassing been seen,
>
> At Peckham, Deptford, Bow, and Stepney Green;
>
> To fill their rooms, they tickets give to all
>
> That will accept them, for their public ball.
>
> When they together get this motley host,
>
> Of numbers and connection they will boast,
>
> Though not to half a dozen known at most.
>
> Some give to girls (I ladies should them call),
>
> Tickets for distribution for their ball
>
> How, when and where they canvass, they're not nice,
>
> In chapel, playhouse, or upon the ice—
>
> All's one to them, the chapel, or the play,
>
> They go to canvass, not to learn and pray.
>
> When Irving raves, they only stare and nod,
>
> And court, not listen, to the word of God.
>
> Richard unheeded, for a horse may call,
>
> Whilst they make parties for professor's ball;
>
> It is always ladies who perform this task,
>
> Not such as dare not of men a favour ask;
>
> Who run and scream, and muffle up their eyes,
>
> And if men only look, affect surprise.
>
> But those who think such notions affectation,
>
> And talk to men without much reservation,
>
> And trust a kiss may not be ruination.
>
> Such are the ladies, such the means they try,
>
> And thus with guests the ball room they supply.
>
> They search for those who can, or try to dance,
>
> Set down their names, wherever they have a chance
>
> Of bringing one their viands to partake,
>
> And pay for hat or cloak, for custom sake:
>
> They gain addresses, invitations send
>
> For their grand balls, to Mister A----------, and friend
>
> Who reads and wonders how these tickets came,
>
> (As he, professor knows not e'en by name),
>
> Much more to think how he's deserved the same:
>
> Or how he had the great professor served,
>
> Or by what means such friendship he deserved.
>
> He yet conceives, though he don't recollect,
>
> It must be sent through knowledge and respect;
>
> He goes determined, if he dance or not,
>
> To see some old acquaintance heed forgot:
>
> Expects professor will some notice take,
>
> And by the hand to have a friendly shake.
>
> But what must be the visitor's surprise,
>
> Professor never before had met his eyes;
>
> Nor does he come to meet congratulation,
>
> Not e'en the usual friendly salutation:
>
> But passes by to serve a glass of grog,
>
> With something like the manners of a hog;
>
> The mystery's now developed, and the guest
>
> May very easily discern the rest.
>
> This is enough, if visitors attend,
>
> To prove the friendship of this liberal friend:
>
> And what his motives are before they go,
>
> The hat and coffee scheme will let them know.
>
> They find professor knows not one in twenty,
>
> He cares not who they are, if they drink plenty;
>
> The present guests they mostly re-invite,
>
> And furnish tickets for their friend's next night.
>
> Next day, fresh invitations go to all
>
> They think will come to their forth-coming ball;
>
> For they like strangers who have not been caught,
>
> This is the way fresh companies are brought.
>
> There's some pragmatic teachers (that's well known),
>
> Who would not Vestris their superior own:
>
> Whose pride does with their vanity keep pace,
>
> But then such pride would e'en a fool disgrace.
>
> As they to hops at public houses go,

>
> Yet not as guests do they such balls attend,
>
> But as directors, there to superintend:
>
> And have their names in print, that they may be
>
> Kings of the hop, or gallimaufry.
>
> Bel. Is this their pride? then all the world must know,
>
> Their pride is like the peacock's, noise and show,
>
> Jem. For etiquette, these Balls are not you'll see,
>
> What Almack's is, or Connolly's used to be,
>
> Confined to dancing, and the most refined,
>
> Which was, and is, with etiquette combined:
>
> For at these balls, where our professors go,
>
> There's all the tricks and mummery of a show:
>
> And as to guests, they're lowest of the low.
>
> Here sorry toss-pots these professors own,
>
> And to the vilest trulls they must be known;
>
> Pie-men, lolly-pop, and hay-band makers,
>
> Daffers, duffers, mop-stick weavers, and undertakers,
>
> Oft constitute the guests at these grand balls,
>
> Dispute precedence, and demand the calls.
>
> The conduct of the guests whom you find there,
>
> Is such as you would meet with at a fair:
>
> For they not only smoke, drink, dance, and sing,
>
> But show you wonders with the balls and ring.
>
> Between the dances (whilst you recreate)
>
> A sword, sometimes, you see a fellow eat:
>
> And hear professor oft attention call,
>
> For siffleurs and chin music at the ball.
>
> Uncloaked and smoking, in a wicker chair,
>
> Sits Shakespeare's Richard (says the bill of fare),
>
> Who drops his pipe, and starts, to make folks stare.
>
> When he's tugged hard "in king Cambyses' vein",
>
> The tensor then becomes himself again.
>
> Silvester Daggerwoods do here resort,
>
> To make a benefit, as well as sport
>
> Poor Terpsichore would here in sackcloth weep,
>
> To see such dancing, as would shame a sweep.
>
> For Ball's a mere pretence, for you might bring
>
> Sots, P---------- and W----------, to drink, smoke, dance, and sing;
>
> To balls like these, do our professors lend
>
> Their names, and personally such balls attend.
>
> Bel. How can such great professors like to go,
>
> (Like petty drivellers at a penny show,
>
> To rank themselves the lowest of the low?
>
> Jem. To them these petty hops such joys supply,
>
> As Cuffs and Almack's, their low taste deny;
>
> They're all "grand balls", for so they say in print,
>
> Whether they're in Saint Giles's, or the Mint.
>
> Bel. And some of those whom our professor graces,
>
> Are often held there, or in such like places,
>
> They every thing nickname and magnify,
>
> That on their words in print you can't rely.
>
> Jem. You know "the man of words, and not of deeds,
>
> Is like a garden that is full of weeds".
>
> They're like the nurse who said, (as fables go)
>
> She to the wolf the peevish child would throw;
>
> The wolf over heard it, and believed the nurse,
>
> But in the end her lying tongue did curse;
>
> For she never meant to do as she proposed,
>
> So on the wolf's credulity imposed
>
> Who, tired of waiting, hungry walked away,
>
> And curses lies and liars to this day.
>
> There are professors who delight in noise,
>
> And treat their guests as they would little boys
>
> To call a dance they now a trumpet blow,
>
> As showmen gather children round a show:
>
> Who hear the trumpet, then take to their legs,
>
> In hopes to see some phoenix, or cock's eggs,
>
> Or learned pig, or mermaid newly taken,
>
> Or some kind pair, who've claimed the flitch of bacon.
>
> So our Professors trope their guests will race,
>
> And sans decorum, scramble for a place;
>
> Bel. The baby guests may run at such a call,
>
> But not discreet frequenters of a ball:
>
> It none can please, except some baby guest,
>
> Jem. I could name scores that ball rooms now infest.
>
> Bel. It is done to make fools think there'll be a crowd,
>
> Where human voice can't reach, however loud;
>
> But some will view them in another light,
>
> And think a crowd may sometimes breed a fight.
>
> That fights at Balls are sadly out of place,
>
> And must the Ball and Ball holders disgrace.
>
> A trumpet might be proper at Vauxhall,
>
> As persons there might stray beyond a call;
>

>
> It is done to make their ball of consequence.
>
> There's one professor, aye, of whom you've heard,
>
> Put out a ball bill, pompous and absurd;
>
> It was an attempt at wit, but such rare stuff,
>
> To read it you would find three lines enough;
>
> And say it was only fit (the muse may weep)
>
> To read, to lull an Alderman to sleep,
>
> Professor said it was meant to make a hit,
>
> But as some phrase it, here "it did not fit".
>
> I've now forgot the wording, but I will
>
> Some future day, produce you this choice bill;
>
> But it is such wit, and so devoid of sense,
>
> To read it through you need have recompense.
>
> Bel. There's few you'll find, but really think they've wit,
>
> And these good souls are fond of using it
>
> On all occasions, whether wrong or right,
>
> They thrust it out, however dull and trite;
>
> And seem to chuckle when they've had their say,
>
> And wonder folks don't laugh as well as they;
>
> And often say they'll tell a funny tale,
>
> Which when rehearsed, turns out quite dull and stale.
>
> They strive with nonsense laughter to provoke,
>
> And laugh with others at each thread-bare joke.
>
> Jem. Such shallow wits but on the surface creep,
>
> And never talk on subjects very deep;
>
> As they've so small a stock, and no supply,
>
> Just like some springs in summer, often dry;
>
> And what they borrow you with ease may know,
>
> And find it word for word in honest Joe.
>
> Your would be wit will stare, and hesitate,
>
> For want of words, and scratch his empty pate;
>
> Then strike his head (to cry out "fool" not willing),
>
> Which being empty, rings like a cracked shilling.
>
> To find real wit you need adopt the plan,
>
> On which Diogenes sought an honest man.
>
> Bel. Balls have like churches lately multiplied,
>
> Though not with equal pious guests supplied.
>
> Jem. Balls formerly were places of resort,
>
> For only the genteel, and better sort
>
> Of company, where strict decorum reigned,
>
> And where admission was not easy gained;
>
> Where none were seen you'd be ashamed to own,
>
> Where rudeness and ill manners were unknown.
>
> The etiquette preserved would plainly show,
>
> The most fastidious moralist might go.
>
> We've yet some balls that well deserve the name,
>
> Which have unsullied still preserved their fame;
>
> This these Professors know and use their wit,
>
> To form their bills these balls to counterfeit.
>
> They try all sorts of titles that will strike
>
> The eye, no matter what, or how unlike
>
> The usual titles, novelty they say
>
> Will please John Bull, for which he'll always pay.
>
> Cheap dancing too these ball holders well know,
>
> Will many suit and many tempt to go;
>
> They therefore in their ball bills oft pretend,
>
> By friendly titles, dancers to befriend.
>
> Some are "Free balls" termed — some they "friendly call",
>
> These are but lures to get you to the ball;
>
> Direct, or indirect, you pay at all.
>
> How, and by what means it is done I'll clearly show,
>
> As I the system of these gentry know.
>
> If these Ball holders cannot boast of gain,
>
> From the admissions, yet they do obtain
>
> A profit on the various things they vend,
>
> From cloaks and hats, and what the guest may spend,
>
> Some wholly live; whatever they pretend.
>
> From these and other stratagems are gained,
>
> More profit than by teaching is obtained:
>
> Another source of profit some devise,
>
> By which they slyly cozen the excise,
>
> By mixing liquors without licensed leave
>
> To sack the profit and excise deceive.
>
> Some take one license, just by way of blind,
>
> Yet wines and liquors sell of every kind;
>
> With ale and porter, bottled beer, and stout,
>
> Yet all plead ignorance when they're found out.
>
> Bel. To sell without a license, I suppose,
>
> Would any vendor to some fine expose.
>
> Jem. To sell what I have named and be secure,
>
> Three separate licenses you must procure;
>
> To sell without is risk — the law abounds
>
> With penalties for each — some fifty pounds.
>
> But these ball holders nothing have in view,
>
> But gain, for which they cheat the revenue;
>
> Their guests for this are not the better treated,
>
> They and the revenue alike are cheated.
>
> To save the spirits mix it sweet and hot,
>
> That from each shilling eight — pence may be got:
>
> Their wine's not only in short measure sent,
>
> But must in quality yield cent per cent.
>
> With these inducements balls have multiplied,
>
> Where new Professors with the old have vied;
>
> Not as instructors, but who caters best,
>
> And gains the most by viands from their guests.
>
> Bel. Instead of dancing masters, they should write
>
> "Unlicensed victuallers", then their title's right;
>
> The term "professor's" used by way of lure,
>
> To make their guests believe they're quite secure.
>
> Jem. These quacks care not who dance ill or well,
>
> If they can plenty of refreshments sell
>
> That's their main object, though it's not confessed,
>
> For that they strive to fill their room with guests.
>
This to effect they tickets give to all
>
> They know or hear of, to attend their ball.
>
> Numbers they want, and those who spend their cash
>
> To show their consequence and cut a dash;
>
> Who ask the ladies what they like to choose,
>
> And seem offended when the belles refuse.
>
> And those who drink for nought but drinking sake,
>
> And will insist all present shall partake;
>
> And those who of long reckonings make a boast,
>
> And pride themselves that they have paid the most;
>
> Who won't dispute the items in the bill,
>
> If wrong cast up — who never takes it ill
>
> Who never reflect, and whose resolves are vain,
>
> Who, ranger like, — next night return again.
>
> Such are the guests they want, not those who are
>
> Economists, and rigid sons of care;
>
> Who only come to dance but never stay,
>
> Like some, to stagger home at break of day;
>
> Who stand in every dance and scarce take breath,
>
> Who fiddlers say, will dance them all to death;
>
> Who always hold that ancient maxim right,
>
> That says, "for health", to bed by twelve at night;
>
> Not those who with the doctors do agree,
>
> Never to take refreshment after tea
>
> And if they do, then nothing more will take
>
> Beyond an orange, or some trifling cake.
>
> They at their rooms never want such guests as these,
>
> Who bring no profit, therefore cannot please.
>
> For such as these, those great professors say,
>
> "Who only come to dance may stay away;
>
> Such prudent frugal guests will never pay".
>
> Bel. We've here digressed, but this digression's shown
>
> Me some strange practices till now unknown.

### Grand dress balls

> Jem. I'll now begin with what some often call,
>
> And often advertise, "A grand dress ball";
>
> You, from their title, might expect to find
>
> Good company, with elegance combined.
>
> But at those balls you must not be surprised,
>
> If expectations are not realized.
>
> To one of those dress balls one night I went,
>
> When I got there, to my astonishment,
>
> I found, instead of dashing belles and beaux,
>
> Their guests trimmed out in Monmouth street fine clothes.
>
> I made enquiries, who, and what they were,
>
> And found some gents retailers in rag fair:
>
> With maids of all work, and some men of lace,
>
> In borrowed suits, this grand dress ball to grace.
>
> But their disguise could not impose on me,
>
> As by their manners I could plainly see,
>
> They neither had the manner, speech, nor gait,
>
> Of those they vainly strove to imitate.
>
> There was not one well dressed amongst them all,
>
> It was quite a mockery of a grand dress ball;
>
> Nothing like rule or order found I there,
>
> It was noise, dust, drinking, just like Greenwich fair.

### Grand balls

> Their grand balls are the next upon rotation,
>
> On which I now shall make some observation.
>
> Grand is a title which they always call
>
> Each petty hop, that they misname a ball;
>
> To misapply the term they feel no shame,
>
> As all they want is some good striking name.
>
> They try all sorts of titles that will strike
>
> The eye, no matter what, or how unlike;
>
> A striking title's all they have in view,
>
> They care not what, so it be great and new.
>
> The title "grand" on many does impose,
>
> Who know not what they are, and will suppose,
>
> They're what they should be, not what oft they are
>
> A rabble, only fit to grace a fair.
>
> A fight is as usual now at such a ball,
>
> As to see herrings retailed at a stall.
>
> Bel. You from their titles really might expect
>
> Good dancing, and a company select.
>
> Jem. There ought to be, but you will scarce believe
>
> How shamefully the public they deceive;
>
> As I've just said, their company you'll find,
>
> Are such as frequent hops of every kind;
>
> Therefore should you find genteel people there,
>
> It is those imposed on by their bills of fare.
>
> The dancing which you'll find at their grand balls,
>
> Next for remarks and reprehension calls;
>
> Quadrilles well danced, the waltz performed with ease,
>
> And grace that would the most fastidious please
>
> You never see — but shuffling sort of stuff,
>
> That Akenside calls "Dancing in the rough",
>
> And coincides with jumping, not what we
>
> Have at a real grand ball been used to see.
>
> At these quack teachers' balls, the dancers may
>
> Stand up and hop about in their own way;
>
> Wrong for right, which ever way they choose,
>
> And every rule of science may abuse;
>
> For dancing they such hotch-potch substitute,
>
> That brings this polite art to disrepute.
>
> Bel. I saw at one of those grand balls you name,
>
> Dancing one night a bouncing city dame,
>
> Who goes to balls, but hops as she were lame.
>
> And many who had steps in great profusion,
>
> But wrong applied, whose feet seemed all confusion.
>
> Jem. The appropriate steps these dancers never use,
>
> But hop, and run about like wrangling Jews;
>
> With bawling, "this way, sir", through there, "begin again",
>
> Some push, some pull, some of the band complain.
>
> From rule and order here, they seem exempt,
>
> And often treat professor with contempt.
>
> Bel. Without connection, it is the strangest thing,
>
> How to these balls they can such numbers bring.
>
> Jem. They issue tickets out, that will admit
>
> From two to twenty, just as you think fit.
>
> If you could fill the room, they'd tickets give,
>
> They by refreshment, not by dancing live;
>
> They care not who the guest may be, not they,
>
> If he for coffee, hat, and partner pay.
>
> Bel. The numbers there collected, oft impose
>
> On strangers who too frequently suppose
>
> It is all connection, but not half a score,
>
> To these Professors have been known before.
>
> Jem. As I've described such are the plans of all
>
> Those petty teachers, and those hops they call
>
> "Grand balls" — this subject I'll take up again,
>
> And these Grand Balls more fully will explain.

### Select balls

> The balls they call select, shall next by me
>
> Be here explained; you then at once will see,
>
> How far they with their title do agree.
>
> They often use the terms, "grand" and "select",
>
> In their announcements — this is puff direct,
>
> For in one visit you'll the cheat detect.
>
> To gain access you need of no petition,
>
> Offer them money — then you'll gain admission.
>
> Bel. But do they all their companies select?
>
> Jem. I'll tell you how this matter they effect.
>
> These teachers use the term "select", but care
>
> No more who comes, than showmen at a fair;
>
> Nor how they bring a company, not they,
>
> But call them all good company that pay —
>
> Their companies are quite select, I'll show,
>
> For they select out every one they know.
>
> Bel. How do they ladies so select obtain?
>
> Who are their gentlemen? You'll perhaps explain.
>
> Jem. They ransack booths at fairs, and petty hops,
>
> And canvass all straw hat, and milliners' shops
>
> For ladies — for such are ladies, one and all;
>
> Bel. Aye, every girl's a lady at a ball.
>
> Jem. Their gentlemen you'll find are much the same,
>
> They're gentlemen in little but the name;
>
> They're not quite what Lord Chesterfield would call
>
> Fit gentlemen to visit a grand ball:
>
> Who never contend nor scramble for a place,
>
> Who take and leave their partners with a grace;
>
> Who would five hours in the rain or cold,
>
> Wait for their partners, and never frown or scold.
>
> They don't resemble those, I fear you'll say,
>
> They clap and hiss like dustmen at a play;
>
> Dictate the hand, and amidst quadrilles call reels,
>
> And silence claim, by rattling with their heels:
>
> Contend for places, claim the top by right,
>
> And when proved wrong, maintain the place by might.
>
> Demand a call, but when it's named can't show
>
> That they the figures, steps, or music know;
>
> They less politeness to each other employ,
>
> Than our old foes showed us, at Fontenoy.
>
> Bel. There's this excuse, if it can he allowed,
>
> They to politeness never yet have bowed,
>
> On men and manners they've no strictures made,
>
> Know only Cocker, and the tricks of trade.
>
> Of Chesterfield they've never read one word,
>
> And Rochefaucault's a name they never heard;
>
> You might as well to them in Coptic preach,
>
> As famed Galateo's genteel precepts teach.
>
> They never heard of Bacon, West, or Locke,
>
> And ball room etiquette their nerves does shock;
>
> They're only versed in Tom and Jerry flash,
>
> And that they use, as spendthrifts do their cash.
>
> The dancing at these balls you'll seldom find,
>
> Either to rule or reason is confined;
>
> Professor's object's not who may excel
>
> In dancing, but what viands he may sell;
>
> He never preaches abstinence, nor says
>
> "Late hours and drinking shorten people's days";
>
> Nor recommends the guests to pause, add think
>
> Of home, and of long reckonings there they drink.
>
> If with his viands they increase his bill,
>
> And should get tipsy, he'll not take it ill —
>
> Such are the guests they always like to choose,
>
> And thus they do the term "select" abuse.
>
> The public with these balls they oft deceive,
>
> For strangers by their titles oft believe
>
> That they with scrupulous nicety do choose
>
> Their company, and at these balls refuse
>
> All persons who can't prove their reputation
>
> Is far above a low and grovelling station,
>
> In means and manners, and quite fit to grace
>
> Almack's, or any other splendid place;
>
> But they're mistaken, as I'll prove to you,
>
> The holders of these Balls have no such view;
>
> For they've no scruples who they may admit,
>
> For money's all they want to make you fit.
>
> Without a question, pay but at the door,
>
> They will admit you, though never seen before.
>
> They're not concerned when they've your money got,
>
> How you can dance, or if you dance or not
>
> A stranger at these balls might be surprised,
>
> To find them only common hops disguised.

### Characteristic balls

> That you may now fresh information gain,
>
> "Characteristic balls" I'll next explain.
>
> The holders of these balls would be afraid,
>
> To give their proper name, "A masquerade";
>
> "Characteristic's" to evade the law,
>
> And keep these gentry from the lion's paw;
>
> But "Masquerade" they dare not advertise,
>
> As that at once the Police would apprise
>
> Of their illegal tricks, which might perchance
>
> To prison lead these gentlefolks a dance;
>
> Where they'd be made to dance against their will,
>
> By taking steps upon the Treading Mill.
>
> To have these balls the holders must receive,
>
> Either the Chamberlain's license or his leave;
>
> Without such leave, all parties in the place
>
> May be imprisoned, and fined with the disgrace
>
> Of being convicted by the Vagrant act,
>
> Some late transactions prove this is the fact.
>
> To evade the law they try another way,
>
> And give out tickets gratis, but then they
>
> Expect you will of them your dresses hire,
>
> And pay for them whatever they require.
>
> They know the Chamberlain will never give
>
> Sanction to them, nor license while they live;
>
> They therefore by fictitious title, call a masquerade, "Characteristic ball".
>
> They run all risques, as gain is their intent,
>
> And disregard the acts of Parliament
>
> They hire rooms, and care not what disgrace
>
> They bring upon the company, or the place.
>
> Although they call their company select,
>
> Yet their good word alone will not protect
>
> Them always — two instances I have seen,
>
> At Bow street, and Saint Martin's lane,
>
> I mean: Where the whole company were lately caught,
>
> And to the magistrate by force were brought;
>
> And some to durance vile, remorseless sent,
>
> And all were publicly exposed who went.
>
> The ladies were all persons of renown,
>
> And most of them well known by half the town;
>
> Bat some real gentlemen with them were brought,
>
> But they by chance were there decoyed and caught.
>
> The dancing laws you'll find, are little known,
>
> To those they most concern, in this great town.
>
> Bel. I know but little of them, I must own.

### Laws relative to dancing

> Jem. These laws the public often misconceive,
>
> And to their cost, themselves they oft deceive;
>
> From hear-say stories told by rogues and fools,
>
> To whom they're either made the dupes or tools.
>
> They're like old feudal laws, when you compare
>
> These laws with sense and reason, and are
>
> Degrading and severe, when you transgress:
>
> They want revising, all the town confess.
>
> Bel. It will oblige me much to hear you state
>
> When they were made, their bearings, and relate
>
> What penalties, and what they call the act,
>
> And how you may it's rigour counteract.
>
> Jem. I am no lawyer, nor can I pretend
>
> To undertake an action to defend;
>
> It is the provisions of the act that I
>
> Shall here explain, but wholly must rely
>
> On memory, and that I really doubt
>
> In the particulars, will not bear me out.
>
> Bel. In formal wording I'm not over nice,
>
> Just state the outline — that will me suffice.
>
> Jem. Well — that I'll do in what they call a trice.
>
> This act you'll find the public did obtain
>
> The 25th of George the Second's reign.
>
> This act is called "an act for the preventing
>
> Thefts and robberies, and for regulating
>
> Places of public amusement, (where
>
> For payment, you may public dancing share).
>
> It likewise in its clauses does combine
>
> Imprisonment, with very heavy fine
>
> For keepers of all houses of ill fame" —
>
> Disorderly houses also fare the same.
>
> Bel. It seems a complicated act, combined
>
> With other things; to dancing not confined;
>
> I'm told it is arbitrary, and too severe.
>
> Jem. The pains and penalties you now shall hear,
>
> To show if you transgress what you've to fear.
>
> I'll briefly state the act of Parliament —
>
> "Any house, garden, room, or tenement,
>
> Kept for public dancing, or entertainment,
>
> In London, Westminster, or twenty miles around,
>
> In which there shall be public dancing found".
>
> Without a license, then, will subject those
>
> To pains and penalties, who do oppose
>
> The law, for strange to say, but it is the fact,
>
> You may be punished by the Vagrant act;
>
> With penalties and fines the act abounds,
>
> The penalty's each time, one hundred pounds;
>
> Which may be gained by any one, who'll sue
>
> Those parties, that such practices pursue.
>
> Bel. It is too severe an act to he unknown,
>
> It wants repealing, every one must own.
>
> Jem. Severe, indeed, to me this act does seem,
>
> For by the clauses you will see they deem
>
> Houses unlicensed, as disorderly,
>
> If there's a dance, however orderly
>
> The company may be, yet by warrant,
>
> Which any sitting magistrate may grant
>
> To any constable, and him employ,
>
> The unsuspecting dancers to annoy
>
> He then may enter, seize all persons found
>
> Therein, and in the watch-house them impound,
>
> Until it shall his worship's humour please,
>
> To bring the culprits forth from little ease
>
> Before him, and then, as he thinks fit,
>
> As rogues and vagabonds, can them commit
>
> To prison — it is also left to his discretion,
>
> To hind them over to the quarter session,
>
> Where they may be, whatever be their station,
>
> Humanely then discharged by proclamation.
>
> Bel. Such harsh degrading clauses all must own,
>
> For such offences yet were never known.
>
> Jem. Offences call them! what, dancing an offence! —
>
> This act's a stretch of power, a mere pretence
>
> To abridge the amusements of the middling class
>
> This act was framed, and with that view did pass.
>
> Bel. Surely a legislature wise and just,
>
> In which the people always put their trust,
>
> Would never pass it, with such views as these,
>
> Which would the public all at large displease.
>
> Another time this matter we'll debate,
>
> But now I am anxious just to hear you state
>
> When, where, and how, are licenses obtained,
>
> For public dancing — this you've not explained.
>
> Jem. If you for dancing would a license take,
>
> At Michaelmas quarter sessions you must make
>
> Your application, and state why and where,
>
> When all the justices of peace are there;
>
> Four justices at least must seal and sign,
>
> In open court, not privately combine
>
> At adjourned sittings, but in open court,
>
> The clerk their names must publicly report,
>
> "That they have granted unto A or B,
>
> For public entertainment without fee,
>
> A license, unto which they all agree".
>
> It is likewise requisite to mention here,
>
> The license then will only last one year;
>
> Until St. Michaelmas returns, then you
>
> This license at the sessions must renew;
>
> Like those of Saddler's Wells, and of Vauxhall,
>
> And public houses, which are one and all
>
> Licensed by this act, if you enquire;
>
> At Michaelmas, they one and all expire.
>
> Then should you fail for to renew the grant,
>
> Your place is closed, and you to gaol are sent.
>
> When you've the license got, there's one thing more
>
> Must be attended to — you over the door
>
> Must an inscription have in characters
>
> Affixed, which to the act and time refers;
>
> In capital letters too it must appear,
>
> And must be thus made out distinct and clear:
>
> Licensed pursuant to act of parliament,
>
> Of the twenty-fifth of George the Second — meant
>
> For public dancing, to let people know
>
> Where they in safety may to dancing go.
>
> (Sundays excepted) else on every day
>
> They've licensed leave to let folks dance and pay;
>
> Until five P. M. the music dare not play.
>
> On those who keep these rooms you'll find
>
> Other restrictions, with those named combined;
>
> In case of breach, the Magistrates may send
>
> At any time, revoke or else suspend
>
> The license, nor will they, while they live,
>
> Another license to that party give.
>
> To my best judgement, now, I think I have named
>
> The clauses, how and when the act was framed;
>
> With all the pains and penalties thereto,
>
> That you may always for the future know,
>
> Where you in safety may to dancing go.
>
> Bel. I must confess, you now have told me more
>
> Of dancing laws, than I e'er knew before;
>
> Your timely information may prevent
>
> Me that disgrace, which I might e'er repent;
>
> Perhaps I should, if I'd not been apprised,
>
> Have gone to some grand ball that's advertised,
>
> And held at some unlicensed house or place,
>
> And might have been imprisoned with disgrace.
>
> For want of knowledge, I must now confess,
>
> Against the laws I often did transgress;
>
> There's scarce a licensed place in all the town,
>
> Not e'en those halls and taverns of renown,
>
> Where balls are frequent held, I must confess,
>
> It is with surprise I see them all transgress;
>
> And so do half the town without intent
>
> Of breaking through the act of Parliament
>
> For not one in a hundred, who now go
>
> To public balls, did ever hear or know
>
> That such an act existed, nor did those
>
> Who let their rooms, thus knowingly oppose
>
> The law; good order and good company
>
> They think will them protect, indeed they say,
>
> The keeping of the public peace is all
>
> That's requisite; then mischief can't befall
>
> Them or their company, nor think the act
>
> Can all their cautious projects counteract.
>
> Publicans oft unconscious of offence,
>
> Transgress the law, likewise incur expense,
>
> From persons taking of their rooms, who say
>
> It is for a private party, yet for pay
>
> Let people in — this is enough; in fact,
>
> They're then within the meaning of the act.
>
> Not knowing of this act, they only try
>
> To avoid what is termed disorderly;
>
> To avert the danger, should it e'er accrue,
>
> And screen themselves, this plan they oft pursue;
>
> They mostly have a constable attend
>
> Their Balls, and one they think will them befriend,
>
> In case the ball should reach his worship's ears,
>
> He then can satisfy his doubts and fears;
>
> Assure him it was respectable and quiet,
>
> No naughty women, tippling, brawl, or riot;
>
> But was composed of gentlemen and wives,
>
> (Who, all the world know, lead good honest lives)
>
> They think this will his worship satisfy,
>
> On this alone these people do rely;
>
> They never think the law does further go,
>
> Because his worship may not chance to know
>
> This act exists, for magistrates have been
>
> As dull and ignorant quite, as other men.
>
> And petty constables you'll often find,
>
> If you enquire, are rogues and fools combined;
>
> Like "Dogberry" of old, they're just the same,
>
> And only differ from him as to name;
>
> Often pretend to understand the law,
>
> To give advice, or else to find a flaw.
>
> Know all proceedings, and what acts did pass,
>
> But it is at public houses over a glass;
>
> Whoever takes their advice will surely fail,
>
> Lose suits and costs, and curse them in a jail.
>
> There's many a publican, as I've heard say,
>
> Through such advice has had the fine to pay;
>
> At almost every public house, you'll find
>
> They've had a dance, or something of the kind;
>
> Have all unwittingly transgressed the act,
>
> And may be sued by those who'll prove the fact.
>
> There's one thing more, of which they're not aware,
>
> They're not even privileged at Bartholomew fair;
>
> No saving clause, that lady Holland's guest
>
> May privileged dance; they're classed among the rest;
>
> Before the court of pie poudre, may be
>
> Arraigned, and punished for their jollity.
>
> Bel. There's one thing more, before we go,
>
> I wish to ask, and which no doubt you know;
>
> If private persons take a room, are they
>
> For dancing there made subject for to pay
>
> The fine, or punished as the act describes;
>
> Or is it doubtful how the law decides?
>
> Jem. It is public dancing, music, and the like
>
> Amusements, where you'll find the law does strike.
>
> Bel. I wish to know, does not the act protect
>
> Subscription balls, and those they call select?
>
> Jem. How far the law may in these cases go,
>
> I am not sufficient lawyer now to show;
>
> Though they may at the door no money take,
>
> It is plain these balls are for amusement sake;
>
> Public amusement you must know, is meant
>
> To he suppressed by act of Parliament,
>
> Without you have a license for the same,
>
> You're liable — it matters not the name
>
> You give the place or ball, be what it may,
>
> Without a license you the fine must pay —
>
> To me this seems the meaning of the law,
>
> Yet some "qui tam" perhaps may find a flaw.
>
> Bel. Tell me the course informers do pursue,
>
> When they the penalties have got in view.
>
> Jem. Two persons going to a dance, where they
>
> Do for amusement only sixpence pay,
>
> Have only then to prove the place and time;
>
> That's quite enough to constitute the crime;
>
> Get fiddlers names, subpoena them to show
>
> The dance existed, when and where, and how;
>
> That done, the counsel for the plaintiff need
>
> Then only from the act the clauses read;
>
> If this is done, with proving of the fact,
>
> The jury find according to the act.
>
> Informers often with a gang combine
>
> Against publicans, and thus obtain the fine.
>
> One hires a room and holds a dance, in fact
>
> It is done to prove the breaking of the act;
>
> One pays his money at the door, that he
>
> May in the court a casting witness be.
>
> Upon the statute then an action's brought,
>
> And thus the Publican's securely caught;
>
> To evade the penalty he has then no chance,
>
> As these swear money paid, and prove the dance.
>
> Informers often publicans deceive,
>
> By saying they of magistrates have leave;
>
> And talk of liberal guests to bait the lure,
>
> Which makes poor Froth believe he's quite secure;
>
> Like ministers who would the nation gull,
>
> And by the horns take simple Johnny Bull;
>
> Do always raise some strange or specious tale,
>
> By way of tub to throw out to the whale,
>
> For to divert him while they measures take,
>
> To load his back, or bind him to the stake;
>
> And when these foxes get you in their claws,
>
> They to your cost will then expound the laws.
>
> Although the act will punish all who're there
>
> Informers seldom for the company care,
>
> But always look where something's to be got,
>
> And if the company there are not worth shot;
>
> Fall on the landlord to obtain the fine,
>
> Not for the public good, but base design,
>
> To gain from him one hundred pounds, which they
>
> By act of Parliament can make him pay —
>
> In vain he pleads the act he never knew,
>
> Yet he must pay the fine, though it be true.
>
> Bel. By tickets of admission are you sure,
>
> That you're from pains and penalties secure?
>
> Jem. Tickets if sold, are not a legal tender,
>
> And lawyers say, endanger the offender;
>
> Nay, magistrates have late decisions made,
>
> That they've contrived the statute to evade,
>
> For at unlicensed rooms, be where they may,
>
> You dare not dance, if you presume to pay,
>
> Without being open to the Vagrant act,
>
> And may be fined by those who'll prove the fact.
>
> Bel. I must confess I now have heard from you,
>
> More dancing law than I supposed you knew.
>
> Jem. I have not exaggerated, but stated fact,
>
> As near as I can recollect the act.
>
> If Johnson and his gang this act well knew,
>
> They would no longer publicans pursue
>
> For trifling penalties, but leave such gains,
>
> When they could get a hundred for their pains,
>
> And string them like dried herrings, great and small,

>
> Let them take warning, think of costs and debt,
>
> For all are fish who come to Johnson's net,
>
> As he spares none, but takes them by surprise,
>
> And treats them as the spiders do the flies.
>

>
> And may be thought the subject "balls" invading;

>
> To attract the crowd, and catch the passers by;
>
> Bel. Names sometimes are for reasons kept concealed,
>
> And only are from circumstance revealed.
>
> I've known some persons who remained in cog:
>
> For reasons why some donkeys wear a clog:
>
> Jem. Perhaps, Professor like, some lords of state
>
> Remain in cog; to compass something great;
>
> And hides his name from charity, to those
>
> Poor puny souls, who dare his fame oppose,
>
> And by surprise, will on some future day
>
> Break forth, and his astounding name display;
>
> His rivals will be in the distance hurled,
>
> And our professor pose the dancing world.
>
> The town will then no doubt a deference show
>
> To such "superior talent", also know,
>
> To whom they do such obligations owe.
>
> Bel. We to those balls will now return again;
>
> I'm anxious you their nature should explain.

### Friendly balls

> From this digression I shall now review
>
> What are called "friendly balls", and prove to you,
>
> They are only friendly as to name — for those
>
> Who hold those balls are certain to impose,
>
> On all who go; by stratagem or fraud
>
> They trick their guests, and then themselves applaud;
>
> If to these balls you should gain free admission,
>
> You'll not (depend on it) also get permission
>
> To place your hat or cloak just where you please,
>
> For they are kept till payment of the fees;
>
> Which they with care exact from one and all,
>
> Both friends and foes, who do attend their ball.
>
> Bel. What fees are those, which they presume to take?
>
> Jem. A sort of rate or levy which they make
>
> On every one who goes — this is the way
>
> That they contrive to make all dancers pay.
>
> When you go in, your hat or cloak they take,
>
> Then on the wearer a demand they make
>
> Of certain money, as the usual fee —
>
> To pay it ere you dance, you must agree.
>
> This they pretend is the perquisite of those,
>
> Who have the care of bonnets, hats, and clothes;
>
> A mere pretence! the proprietor it is known,
>
> Gives only poundage, makes the rest his own.
>
> If you comply, there's still one more condition
>
> Must be fulfilled, before you gain admission
>
> To join these balls, a coffee ticket they
>
> Present you with, and then for which they say,
>
> Before you enter, you must also pay.
>
> When gentlemen bring ladies to their ball,
>
> These teachers charge their coffee — this they call
>
> The general practice, and a usual thing,
>
> For gentlemen to pay for those they bring;
>
> Such regulations it is but fair to state,
>
> Do chiefly to the gentlemen relate —
>
> For these professors do a difference show
>
> Betwixt ladies and gentlemen — ladies, they know,
>
> To dances unprovided often go.
>
> They therefore are let off at small expense,
>
> And only pay by way of recompense,
>
> A sixpence for the care of what they bring,
>
> Cloak, hat, or shawl, or any such like thing.
>
> Teachers for pay on gentlemen depend,
>
> Trust each will treat his partner and her friend;
>
> For at refreshment, it is the usual plan,
>
> To place two ladies to each gentleman;
>
> Not ladies of the very squeamish kind,
>
> But such as at these hops and balls you find;
>
> Who'd not refuse a drop of you know what,
>
> If at free cost it can with ease be got:
>
> Who would not fear on Sunday's, as in France,
>
> To leave the church, and join a country dance.
>
> In pious matters they're not very nice,
>
> But hate the whole "society of vice";
>
> Not like some pious senators that cry,
>
> Because some thousands still in errors die,
>
> Nor listen to advice from Mistress Fry.
>
> But many can (oh! shocking!) curse and damn,
>
> And would not fear to ride the old black ram;
>
> Who are not so nice as to refuse to eat,
>
> Because it is the gentlemen who treat;
>
> Or should the matter be disputed, they
>
> But seldom, for themselves insist to pay.
>
> Those ladies often with the master join,
>
> To increase the bill and favour his design;
>
> For services like these he does admit
>
> Them gratis, and such ladies they think fit
>
> To introduce — but for this favour then,
>
> They there must introduce some gentlemen,
>
> For to subscribe to something they may call
>
> A dress, select, or grand, or fancy ball.
>
> One has a scheme superior to the rest,
>
> To sell his coffee and detain his guest;
>
> He makes them take it, if they will or no;
>
> How this is done I'll now attempt to show —
>
> When these who are obliged to watch the clock,
>
> And dread eleven, lest they in vain should knock;
>
> Apply for hat or shoes, they're often shocked,
>
> To hear of "servants out, and closet locked";
>
> And if they should the consequence explain,
>
> Professor swears and tries some keys in vain,
>
> And nods condolence, whilst he counts the gain.
>
> I have made this long digression to explain
>
> Who their ladies are, how they act and gain
>
> Admission, and how these petty teachers live;
>
> Some future time I'll further statements give.
>
> Bel. I must confess you now have told me more
>
> Of their finesse, than I e'er knew before.
>
> Jem. There's still one project I have not yet stated,
>
> Which in Professors should have been related.
>
> Bel. Let's hear it — time and place shall be excused,
>
> I seek to be instructed and amused.
>
> Jem. To pass off damaged ware, street hucksters cry,
>
> (To ease your doubts) come, "taste before you buy";
>
> But if you taste, and should refuse to deal,
>
> You'll soon the merits of their candour feel.
>
> Bel. That's very true — it is what they call a lay:
>
> For those who taste, are always made to pay.
>
> There's some Professors I can't mention here,
>
> Who of connection have some ground for fear;
>
> To fill their Rooms, they to the town now bawl,
>
> "Two lessons gratis if you join our ball".
>
> It is meant to rival (may be plainly seen)
>
> The "Supper gratis", and the trumpet scheme;
>
> For these poor souls, if they can't boast of wit,
>
> With some device all strive to make a hit.
>
> Jem. They soon will teach you all you want to know,
>
> If you to these professors balls will go:
>
> We therefore shortly may expect to meet
>
> Teachers with fiddles, playing in the street
>
> "Stoney Batter" to Macadamizers,
>
> Or with a board turned walking advertisers;
>
> Or using steps (not chassées, more is the pity)
>
> To hawk some golden bubble through the city.

### Free balls

> Bel. The free balls I could wish you'd next review,
>
> That I may know, if what is said, is true
>
> Concerning them; for I've heard many say,
>
> Though they're called free balls, you are made to pay.
>
> Jem. Those miscalled free balls often do disgrace
>
> Their title, the proprietor, and place
>
> In which they're held; instead of free balls, they
>
> Who hold them, always make all comers pay,
>
> Either for music, room, or hat, or clothes,
>
> Or something else they claim, or else propose
>
> With whips and fresh demands to make amends,
>
> For "giving dancing gratis to their friends?"
>
> You'll find these free balls all on the same plan —
>
> Go there, and dance at free cost if you can;
>
> For our professor's "gratis" is the lure,
>
> Who shows the cheat when he has guests secure.
>
> Girl, boy, or serving man is welcome guest,
>
> And maids of all work figure with the rest;
>
> For these free balls, they mostly get their belies
>
> From Conduit Gardens, or from Bagnigge Wells;
>
> From playhouse lobbies, waiting for a call,
>
> Ladies are brought, to grace professor's ball;
>
> Welcome all comers! no matter who or what
>
> They be — from all, there's something to be got,
>
> Either for hat or cloak, or what they spend;
>
> The object's gain, whatever they pretend.
>
> I've heard such fights do at these balls take place,
>
> As any other ball room would disgrace;
>
> But these professors and their guests you'll find,
>
> Are not of the reflecting squeamish kind;
>
> They're used to fights, to tippling, noise, and riot,
>
> And quite unused to order, rule, and quiet.
>
> Bel. Such rude fracas their belles must terrify!
>
> Jem. By no means, they have more philosophy.
>
> They're not those squeamish dames who'd be ashamed
>
> To hear an oath, or "ladies garters" named;
>
> Who will look down when they approach a man,
>
> And always hide their faces with their fan:
>
> Or those, who would a double entendre dread,
>
> When beaux change cards, are carried out for dead:
>
> Or those who think they're ruined with a kiss,
>
> Or would resign their place to each pert miss:
>
> Or those who are at twelve resolved to go,
>
> And leave the ball, likewise a favourite beaux;
>
> Who would drink water, and good wine oppose,
>
> And dread a crowd, although composed of beaux:
>
> Who never talk but when in time and place,
>
> Who never move or dance but with a grace:
>
> Who'd rather go to church, and say their prayers,
>
> Than go to balls and dance to quadrille airs;
>
> Who never slandered rivals friends or foes,
>
> Nor envied others jewels or fine clothes;
>
> Who rail at men, and mean the whole they say,
>
> Who'd rather pray and work, than dress and play:
>
> Nor those who tell their age and never scold,
>
> Who think they're ugly, and would gain be old.
>
> These are not ladies who such balls attend,
>
> They're very different belles, you may depend;
>
> The gentlemen who at these balls you find,
>
> Are as to manners of a similar kind;
>
> They've none of that retiring self command,
>
> When they applaud to merely move the hand,
>
> But clap their hands like vulgar low coal heavers,
>
> And make them sound like marrow bones and cleavers.
>
> For noise and gesture these ball guests you'd say,
>
> Resemble dancing sweeps the first of May.

### Fancy dress balls

> Fancy dress balls must as the next appear,
>
> And what they really are you now shall hear.
>
> Fancy dress balls, some people likewise name
>
> Characteristic, and think they are the same;
>
> (But characteristic as I just have said,
>
> Is meant to signify a masquerade),
>
> a fancy dress balls that, where every guest
>
> Is in appropriate costume strictly dressed;
>
> The face to show the character, and age
>
> They paint, as is the custom of the stage;
>
> The mask's forbid the countenance to aid,
>
> For "fancy ball" means not a "masquerade".
>
> Grand fancy balls have oft been given at court,
>
> Where royalty has sometimes deigned to sport,
>
> Like those which Bath and Almack's now supply,
>
> For taste and fancy with the Court that vie;
>
> Or those which Ranelagh did once contain,
>
> The like of which will scarce be seen again;
>
> But quite unlike such splendid balls are those
>
> Which these professors give, though you'd suppose
>
> From their announcement, that they're still the same;
>
> But they resemble only in the name —
>
> Go to those teachers balls, you then will see
>
> They're nothing like what they pretend to be;
>
> Instead of various characters arrayed
>
> In strict costume, where fancy has displayed
>
> Her boundless whim, to variegate the scene,
>
> Where all the costumes of the world are seen,
>
> Where ages past before you seem to rise,
>
> And strange outlandish beings meet your eyes;
>
> And habits, manners, customs, all are shown
>
> With strict exactness, though before unknown,
>
> Where you the world in miniature may view,
>
> Objects antique, familiar, strange, and new:
>
> Egyptians, Medes, and Greeks walk to and fro,
>
> In costumes worn three thousand years ago.
>
> (When these were nations the most famed on earth,
>
> Where science, arts, and learning had their birth;
>
> But, strange reverse! they're now in darkness hurled,
>
> Who once gave laws and learning to the world).
>
> Here the swift Parthians your eyes will meet,
>
> So famed for victory in their feigned retreat;
>
> In the mind's eye here Marathon you see,
>
> And Salamis and famed Thermopolae;
>
> And gay Palmyra's palaces (no more),
>
> And ancient Troy whose loss we all deplore.
>
> This mutability of human kind,
>
> Must bring some strange reflections to the mind,
>
> And make us cry, oh! Time what hast thou done,
>
> Whither are Tyre, and mighty Babylon?
>
> And lofty Thebes and Ninevah all gone.
>
> And famous nations now all swept away,
>
> The wonder and the terror of their day;
>
> With other wonders history has displayed,
>
> By art produced, and by old time decayed —
>
> At balls like these all may be entertained,
>
> As characters are generally sustained
>
> By those of talent, who can represent
>
> The characters just as dame nature meant.
>
> But at these teachers balls there's not the kind
>
> Of costume I've described — their guests you'll find
>
> Are mostly dressed in their own walking clothes,
>
> Not Fancy Dresses, as you might suppose.
>
> Should persons there in character be found,
>
> They in low slang and ribaldry abound;
>
> They're so unlike to what they represent,
>
> You only by the dress know what is meant;
>
> And at some fancy balls where I have been,
>
> Not even one in strange costume was seen.
>
> Bel. Such balls are meant as catch pennies, by those
>
> Who laugh at all on whom they do impose.
>
> Jem. These teachers care not what they advertise,
>
> Their placards, like themselves, are filled with lies;
>
> Bel. But strangers oft too readily believe
>
> In all they hear and see, and thus deceive
>
> Themselves, who then become the dupes and prey
>
> Of every rogue and sharper of the day.

### Lady patronesses balls

> Bel. I hear some great professors have of late
>
> Been striving much to imitate the great,
>
> In holding balls where they themselves elect
>
> Patronesses, to keep their balls select.
>
> Jem. That's not the object, I will plainly show,
>
> As I the motives of these gentry know;
>
> For their real object, boldly I'll maintain,
>
> Is not propriety, but hope of gain;
>
> How that's effected, I will now explain,
>
> It is done to feed the vanity of those
>
> Fair ladies, who the company compose,
>
> Who never see the drift, but think it fine,
>
> If they as lady patronesses shine.
>
> Bel. With such mock quality, the thing's absurd,
>
> How their election's made, I've never heard;
>
> No doubt the greatest talent is preferred.
>
> Jem. You are mistaken, talent has no avail,
>
> Money and interest only will prevail;
>
> None are elected here by public voice,
>
> The great professor only has the choice;
>
> From all the ladies he pretends to choose,
>
> Those wanting means and interest he'll refuse;
>
> For talent without means here, as at court,
>
> With these professors meet with no support.
>
> As proof this office is bestowed for gain,
>
> A child for once this honour did obtain.
>
> Bel. These selfish wights it is plain now to perceive,
>
> Entirely live by those whom they deceive;
>
> Another question I must ask you — pray
>
> How long in office do these ladies stay?
>
> Jem. They have the honour only for one night,
>
> Succeeding Balls give other dames that right;
>
> One lady may two following nights preside,
>
> But she must pay to gratify her pride;
>
> In either meal or malt, — he is not nice,
>
> But one or both will have, if yon serve twice.
>
> Bel. When these fair dames this envied office fill,
>
> Have they full power, and can they act at will?
>
> Jem. They're patronesses only by the name,
>
> But have no power to perform the same;
>
> It is true they have the title for the night,
>
> But, mark me! these fair ladies have no right
>
> To give admissions, neither to reject
>
> Strangers from entering, though the ball's select;
>
> The great professor's interest is at stake,
>
> They therefore dare not these objections make;
>
> There's one thing more quite requisite to say,
>
> When chosen once, if absent, fines must pay.
>
> Bel. What! fine the ladies! mercy! how absurd!
>
> The most ungallant practice ever heard!
>
> How, or by what means do they exact the fine?
>
> Jem. One great professor levies it in wine.
>
> Bel. That fining ladies is a barbarous plan,
>
> It surely could not emanate from man.
>
> Jem. Ladies must now wear pockets, and what's worse,
>
> To fill the office will require a purse.
>
> Bel. When once appointed "Lady patroness",
>
> What is the office? What do they profess?
>
> Do they as stewards and directors act,
>
> And all the duties of the ball transact?
>
> Do they the ball-room etiquette well know,
>
> And technic terms? Can they the figures show
>
> Of all the various dances now in use,
>
> Quadrilles, the Spanish dances and batteuse,
>
> With English country dances, ecosoise,
>
> The figured reels and stately polonoise?
>
> Do they call out "your places, sirs", and say
>
> "Come, show your number — is it B or A?"
>
> Does their official duty thus extend
>
> That they the gentlemen should recommend
>
> To lady partners, and the ladies suit
>
> With such nice beaux as ladies can't dispute?
>
> Jem. They know no more of what you have here laid down,
>
> Than children know the manners of the town;
>
> For many a patroness has never seen
>
> A ball, or e'en a month at dancing been.
>
> At Almack's balls the patronesses there
>
> Not only have to make the bill of fare,
>
> But choose as guests such as they may think fit;
>
> None but those patronized will they admit;
>
> But our professors take a special care,
>
> Such privileges their ladies never share.
>
> These balls at most can have no other claim,
>
> Than paltry imitations, and the name.

### Charity balls

> Charity balls do likewise now abound,
>
> There's scarce a week but new ones may be found;
>
> The holders of these balls not only state
>
> Some direful tale, but oft exaggerate;
>
> They have different methods, yet they all agree
>
> In calling on the world for charity.
>
> "Fire and famine" oft their placards head,
>
> Or else the name of same good soul just dead;
>
> They various objects have, for some profess
>
> "A widow's call", some " children in distress".
>
> Others (to gain the stewards some renown)
>
> Propose relief to half the poor in town.
>
> Strangers, who read, if they believe, must own
>
> That all mankind are philanthropic grown.
>
> Bel. I cannot help applauding the intent,
>
> When charity by them is really meant.
>
> Jem. It is praiseworthy and kind, all must confess,
>
> To give to objects really in distress.
>
> I've seen subscriptions for some persons made,
>
> Who constantly make charity a trade,
>
> Whilst modest merit often starves unknown,
>
> Afraid to ask, ashamed their case to own;
>
> While insolent and public paupers share,
>
> Unmerited, both means and sumptuous fare.
>
> From all who grievous tales of want relate,
>
> The public seldom can discriminate
>
> The real deservers, and too often give
>
> To those wire as impostors wholly live.
>
> I have known some cases, which at balls occurred,
>
> The truth of which by many is averred,
>
> How persons have obeyed a widow's call,
>
> And taken tickets to support her ball;
>
> And that they might the worthy object aid,
>
> Have previously for all their tickets paid;
>
> Yet when these friends do at the ball attend,
>
> They find their charity they must extend,
>
> The room and band to pay for, or else they
>
> Must pocket the affront, and go away.
>
> But all do not subscribe the cause to serve,
>
> Nor does their charity that name deserve.
>
> Bel. It is not all gold that glitters, you well know,
>
> For half their charity's mere outside show.
>
> Jem. Many to have their names in print subscribe,
>
> And make their charity a sort of bribe.
>
> As some subscribe through vanity alone,
>
> And others hope for faults they shall atone;
>
> And some propose these Balls in hopes to gain
>
> Some office they've not merit to obtain,
>
> As stewards or directors, or to be
>
> Appointed masters of the ceremony;
>
> A badge of office on their clothes to wear,
>
> A band or star, or else a wand to bear;
>
> These honours on them awkward do appear,
>
> Like school boys who break up but once a year.
>
> Such self-created jacks in office, are
>
> For self sufficiency beyond compare:
>
> These officers do often privilege take,
>
> By right of office, and for privilege sake;
>
> Give free admissions to their friends, that they
>
> May dance, though they've no charity to pay,
>
> The dancing at these balls, in general, is
>
> Nice sport for dancers, if they choose to quiz:
>
> Many stand up to dance, though they don't know
>
> A step or figure, or which way to go;
>
> But, in confusion, run about and stare,
>
> Just like stray pigs when hunted in a fair;
>
> To set them right, there's not the smallest hope,
>
> You might as well strive to convert the Pope;
>
> For ignorance is never wrong, they say,
>
> Like pig on rope, they plunge on their own way.
>
> These Balls do teachers harm, for many go
>
> To dance, who not one step of dancing know,
>
> But jump about and satisfied remain,
>
> And think all right, if nobody complain.
>
> Six lessons often make a feel presume
>
> To take the lead, and consequence assume,
>
> If he can through a figure blundering go,
>
> Though he has not one dancing step to show.
>
> These charity balls produce a spurious race
>
> Of dancers, quite devoid of art and grace,
>
> Who pester every public place where they
>
> Can gain admission, though they seldom pay.
>
> Though I've made these remarks, do not suppose
>
> It is done that I may charity oppose;
>
> For I applaud the philanthropic zeal
>
> Of those who for their fellow creatures feel:
>
> It is in defence of dancing I exclaim,
>
> All other views and motives I disclaim.

### Annual balls

> The annual balls I'll next explain, that you
>
> May see these Balls brought fairly into view;
>
> There's scarce a teacher, either great or small,
>
> But every season has his annual ball.
>
> Some teachers have their annual balls, which are
>
> Thus named, you'll find, the public to ensnare;
>
> They call them thus in hopes it may appear
>
> They only have one Ball within the year.
>
> To miss it, some couldn't satisfied remain,
>
> Until that day twelve month should come round again;
>
> But when they've been, what must he their surprise!
>
> Another Annual Ball next mouth supplies,
>
> Which makes these people scarce believe their eyes;
>
> Who little know the great professor's aim
>
> Is to catch strangers by some specious name.
>
> Bel. To account why annual balls come round so soon,
>
> They reckon years, like Hindoos, by the moon;
>
> They thus may have twelve "annual balls" a year,
>
> And make the time quite reasonable appear.
>
> Jem. They seldom care for what the world may say,
>
> If they draw strangers to their balls to pay;
>
> Many print "annual balls", and what's still more,
>
> Were never known to have a ball before;
>
> They think it will pass them off upon the town,
>
> As long established and of some renown.
>
> They number them like tickets for a ball,
>
> As their first number's never very small;
>
> Mostly with twenty they begin, to show
>
> They've long taught dancing, and the art must know;
>
> Yet some of these professors, I'll engage,
>
> Are not much more than twenty years of age.
>
> One has Parisian Balls, but those who dance
>
> Find nothing at them like those held in France;
>
> The name is all you'll find that's French, the rest
>
> Is but a common English dance at best.

### Subscription balls

> Subscription balls must next attention claim,
>
> Those by impostors held that bear the name;
>
> Who advertise them on our gentry's plan,
>
> And seem to imitate them all they can.
>
> Bel. In title only, for their plans you'll find,
>
> When they're compared, are of a different kind;
>
> It is true that they Subscribers strive to gain,
>
> And try all means their money to obtain.
>
> A term of balls they will engage to give,
>
> Which seldom is completed whilst they live;
>
> They care not how nor whom they do admit,
>
> All that bring money they make amply fit
>
> To join these balls, not like the rich and great,
>
> Who to subscribers often hesitate,
>
> If they're not of high birth, rank, and station,
>
> And oft refuse great lords of the creation,
>
> Because they are not the noblesse of the nation.
>
> The gentry have Committees, and rely
>
> That they subscribers rank and merit try;
>

### The English country dance

***

### A country dance

As it is named, (or more properly an English country dance) almost universally known as the national dance of English, is constructed on mathematical principles, clearly displayed in its operative effect, when properly and well performed. It is formed of two principal features, videlicet figures and steps, which, for the execution, government and display of their several movements and evolutions, are united with their indispensable auxiliary, music: but independent of the scientific structure of the dance, there are secondary features, named ornaments and embellishments, and which are necessary to the performance of the figures and steps to the music, as they apply and are connected with each other in a graceful and easy manner. The figures, which form various evolutionary movements in circular, serpentine, angular, and straight lines, are formed into a variety of different lengths, (as shown by the diagrams in the complete system of English country dancing) and require a variety of different steps or movements of the feet in their performance to music appropriately adapted thereto. A country dance is formed of an indefinite number of ladies and gentlemen, not less than six. The ladies and gentlemen are placed in two rows of lines parallel with each other; the one consisting of ladies, which is called the ladies' side; and the other of gentlemen; which is called the gentlemen's side; every lady is opposite a gentleman, who are called partners. The couples being so placed, form which is termed "a set", and are demonstrated by different technical appellations, according to their situations, or the manner in which they are employed in the dance. The subjoined sketch will more clearly elucidate the form and construction of an English country dance, as formed into various sets, as Set A, Set B, Set C; also the formation of the major and minor sets, of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd or top, central, and bottom couples; likewise the leading, neutral and auxiliary couples, top and bottom of the set, &c.

*Figure 1 omitted.*

### Explanation of the diagrams and characters contained in the above form and construction of a country dance
* Leading set is that set, however many there may be, which is privileged to call the first dance, and is generally called the first set, of Set A, see figure 1 and the article "Sets and divisions of the dance".
* Minor set; any three couples in the general set performing the figure within themselves is termed "Minor set"; how these sets are formed and the number every dance will admit of, may be seen by the diagrams and article "Minor set".
* Ladies and gentlemen's side, is shown in the 1st of the Set A, and is known by, the ladies always having the top of the room or set on their right hand, and the gentlemen on their left.
* Across the dance, means across the set.
* Top of the dance or set, is from whence the dancing commences (see the form and construction of a country dance), and is on the right hand of the ladies, and on the left of the gentlemen. Should the room be square, instead of placing 3 sets parallel with each other, 4 sets might be formed, as shown at figure 12.
* Top couple is the same as first couple; there are the top couple in general and in the minor set, see the article "Minor set".
* Auxiliary couples are those that assist the leading couple in the performance of the dance, they are active and inactive; see diagram 3 and 10, and the article "Auxiliary couples".
* Lady and gentleman: when the appellations of lady and gentleman are made use of in a minor set, the leading couple (whether at top, centre and bottom), is meant, if no other lady or gentleman are otherwise particularly alluded to.
* Neutral couple, is an inactive couple not required in the performance of the figure; they generally divide the minor set, but are sometimes included in it. See Figures 1 and 4 and the article "Neutral couple".
* Central couple; when the leading couple is acting in the centre of a minor set, it is called the central couple, that title never belongs to the second couple: see "Minor set".
* Whole figure, is a figure that is whole, perfect and indivisible, beginning and ending in the same place; see diagram 10 and the article "Whole figures".
* Down the middle, is a movement made between the couples, in the direction of from top to bottom; see figure 2.
* The set: when a number of ladies and gentlemen, their partners, stand opposite each other in two parallel lines, in dancing order, whey a called a set, as shown in the plan of a country dance, and in the article "Sets and divisions of the dance".
* Set or setting, dancing in one place; frequently called foot or footing.

### Sets or divisions of the dance

A country dance is formed into different sets or divisions when the company are too numerous for one set, not only that a greater variety of calls may be had, but also to prevent the fatigue occasioned by the too great length of the set, a set containing in length, or in one line,thirty or forty couples may be divided into two sets, by placing a form or drawing line across the middle of the set.

The following diagram is the form and construction of a country dance, composed of two sets, formed in one straight line or row.

*Figure omitted.*

When the width of the room will admit, and the company are sufficiently numerous, they may be divided into different divisions and placed in parallel lines, at a convenient distance from each other, having respectively the top of the set at the same end or part of the room: they may be distinguished from each other by numerical figures or letters, as Set 1 or Set A, Set 2 or Set B, &c. Notwithstanding that that they all branch from Set 1 or Set A, and are properly but a continuation of that set formed into divisions according to room, yet they have their respective privileges respecting the "calls". Set 1 or A call the first dance, Set 2 or B the second, Set 3 of 3 the third, &c. Should there be no more than three sets, after the call of Set 3 or C, the call goes back to Set 1 or A, and No. 2 in that set call the fourth dance; then No. 2 in Set 2 or B the fifth dance, &c. Whatever dance is called, and in which ever set it may be, the other sets are governed by it respecting tune and figures, thus: if Set C has the call, Sets A and B must consult them respecting the figure, and perform it precisely in the same manner; any alteration or deviation being considered as a mark of disrespect to the lady who calls the dance. The manner of forming this sets or divisions may be seen by "The construction of a country dance", p. 159. In forming them, they must be divided as equally as possible with respect to the number of couples, that the respective sets may finish the dance as nearly as possible at the same time. The ladies being each furnished with a ticket, bearing the name of the set to which they belong, with the number thereon inscribed according to their situation in the dance, as A No. 1, B No. 2, &c.: should place them in a conspicuous part of their dress to prevent disputes respecting places, (videlicet the "Etiquette of the ball room", in "The complete system of English country dancing"). It frequently occurs, that gentlemen's side, which ought to be avoided (except where there are not an equal number of ladies and gentlemen present) as it destroys the appearance of the construction of the dance, and tends to produce mistakes in the performance of the figures, particularly with those persons not thoroughly acquainted with the figure of the dance.

### Distance of standing

The proper distance of the lines formed by the ladies and gentlemen from each other is about four feet and a half, and the distance of the respective couples from each other is about two feet and a half. The proper distance and the keeping of the lines truly parallel is necessary to the correct performance of the figures, every person in the set having thereby an opportunity of seeing the various evolutions of the figure performed by the leading couples, which very frequently proves of the greatest utility to those persons in the dance unacquainted with the figures, and prevents the confusion that would otherwise occur. Should the company be numerous, or the room not of sufficient length to admit the whole of the persons to stand up in one set, they may be arranged and formed according to the width of the room into other sets parallel with each other (ride "Construction of the country dance", and the article "Division of sets"), and numbered in succession, Set 1, Set 2, &c.; or distinguished by letters as Set A, Set B, &c. These divisions may be considered as the parts of first set, being properly a continuation of that set, formed into divisions for the sake of convenience. In performing the dance, the couples, by changing situations, lose the original name or character attached to them, and acquire another, according to the situation they become placed in, or the operative principle of the dance. The technical names of characters attached to the respective couples occur in every country dance, and are permanent in certain situations, and the names of many of the figures are derived from them. The learner must therefore understand them ere he can be supposed properly to connect and apply them in the formation of a country dance. The principal of them are the "minor set", the "leading couple", the "neutral couple", the "auxiliary couples", the "top", "bottom", and "central couples", or "first", "second", and "third couples".

### The minor set

Is formed of three couples, which is sufficient for the performance of any country dance figure constituting in themselves a perfect set, so that every three couples in a general set performing a figure within themselves, is properly termed a minor set, having a top, bottom and central couple, enabling them to perform every figure from every given situation in the dance; the minor set is formed and varied by the progressive motion of the dance, and are more or less numerous, according to the number of persons composing the dance; for instance, a general set consisting of twenty-four couples (the dance being in full action) will have (when the fourth, or couple below the minor set is the neutral couple, as seen at figure 1) six minor sets; if the neutral couple is included in the minor set (as in figure 7), then there will be eight minor sets in a dance of twenty-four couples. Minor sets may be formed in any part of the general set, where it shall occur that the leading or top couple of the minor set have two couples below; videlicet a second and a third couple to act with them or where the leading couple are performing a figure in the centre; in which case, the couples forming the minor set are differently termed, the leading couple being called the central; the third the bottom; and the couple who stand second at the commencement of the figure will then be the first or top couple (see figure 5 in "The construction of a county dance"), thereby losing their original names or characters, immediately the leading couple perform the progressive figure. When first, second, and third couples, or top, centre, and bottom, are mentioned, the dancer should be acquainted as to which of two they should belong (the general or minor set) or he will be otherwise misled. In the general set, the numerical order is regulated accordingly as they are given out at the calling up of the dance; and top and bottom only relate to the top and bottom couple of the dance or general set. When the leading couple is at the top, the second couple is properly the central couple (yet it never assumes that name), being reserved for the leading couple, when they in the performance of the figure occupy the place of the second couple, who consequently become the top couple, and therefore, when the central couple is named, the leading couple alluded to are acting in the centre. The third couple become the bottom couple, immediately on the leading couple becoming the central one, and perform any figure or figures required from that situation; the minor set thereby have no nominal central couple. Such are those that finish the figure with a progressive one, and have no figure performed from the centre by the leading couple.

### Leading couple

Is the couple going down the dance; and there will be as many leading couples as minor sets in a dance, so that a dance of sixty couples would have twenty leading couples, the dance being in full activity.

### Auxiliary couples

Are those couples in a minor that that assist the leading couple in the performance of the figures, either actively or inactively. Some minor sets contain one, others two; but no dance can be formed without one. Their numbers are governed by the direction of figures, and the couples they employ or require in their performance. When a dance contains but one auxiliary couple, it will be composed of figures that in their performance require and employ the leading and the second couple only, or contain a neutral couple within the minor set, hence the second couple becomes the auxiliary couple, whether active or inactive: and every dance containing a figure or figures employing a whole minor set, or by any means connecting themselves with the bottom or third couples, and the neutral couple being the fourth or couple below, the minor set will have two auxiliary couples, active or inactive, according the the nature of the figures. There are some individual figures, that in their performance do no require an auxiliary couple, such as "allemande", "turn your partner", &c.; but every dance must contain one at least as no dance can be performed without a progressive figure, requiring for its performance the second couple. The third couple may be an auxiliary one at one part of the figure, and not at another; but whenever it is employed or required, it is considered as belonging to the dance, the second couple being always auxiliary.

### Active auxiliary couples

Are those couples that actively assist the leading couple in the performance of the figures, as "right and left", "set and change sides", — "hey", — "hands six round", where the figure of the dance cannot be performed without the active assistance of the other couple or couples; for were they to remain stationary, the figure could not be completely performed. A dance may contain either one or two, or be composed of inactive auxiliary couples, according to the nature of the figures of which it may be composed (see "The complete system of English country dancing", where it is shown how the figures employ the couples, and where they begin and end). In "Sir David hunter blair" single figure, there will be one active auxiliary couple, which will be in "set and hands across and back again" (videlicet "Companion to the ball-room"). In "Nancy Dawson" there will be two active auxiliary couples employs in the figure "hey".

### Inactive auxiliary couples

Are those couples which, although auxiliary couples, and required in the performance of the figure, yet remain wholly stationary and inactive; as in "whole figure at top", — "cast off two couple", — "whole figure on your own sides", — "lead through top and bottom", &c. A dance may contain either one or two, or be composed wholly of active figures, according to the selection. In "the Campbell's are coming", single figure (see "Companion to the ball-room") but one auxiliary couple is required (which is inactive) that is used in the performance of the progressive figure, which employ only the leading couple. In the "Rakish highlandman", (single figure) there are two inactive auxiliary couples.

### Neutral couple

A neutral couple is an inactive couple, not required in the figure, and one that divides the minor sets, by its being the fourth or couple below a minor set; yet it is sometimes the third or bottom couple of and included in the minor set, and is constituted, by affording space, to prevent confusion in the dance, too frequently occasioned by the figures interfering and becoming entangled with each other. Those are neutral couples to which no figure extends. When the dance is in full activity, the number of neutral couples will be in proportion to the number of minor sets contained therein, whether included in the minor set or below it. A dance consisting of thirty couples, the neutral couples included in the minor set will contain ten neutral couples, but if the neutral couple be the fourth, or couple below the minor set, then the dance will contain but seven minor sets, with seven neutral couples attached to them additionally (videlicet "The construction of a country dance"). Every minor set must have a neutral couple either included in it, or attached to it. When the neutral couple is included in the minor set, it is always formed of the third or bottom couple. The constituting of the neutral couple depends entirely on the figures employed in the dance, as all those figures which employ the whole of the minor set constitute the fourth or couple below it; the neutral couple (See "The construction of a country dance", figures 1 & 9). In the performance of "Speed the plough" (see "Companion to the ball-room") either single or double figure, the fourth or couple below the minor set would be the neutral one; the whole of the minor set being employed in one of the figures. In the "Haunter tower", single figure, the neutral couple is included in the minor set, as the figure only employs two couple out of the minor set. The above examples, it is trusted, will be found sufficient.

### Motion and progression of the dance

The dance being constructed, the figure set, &c., the music properly adapted there to must be selected and played to put the dance in motion; the action and progressive motion in the performance of the dance must be understood, in order that every person in it may move progressively towards the bottom and the top regularly, that equal opportunity may be afforded to each to perform their respective parts. The top couple of the general set commence the dance, and after performing the various figures set to the same tune, finish a couple nearer the bottom; and the second will by moving up, become the top couple. The dance commences again, and the leading couple each time the figure is repeated, will progressively gain a couple towards the bottom, and will repeat or perform the figure at many times, as there are couples standing up in the set, not being permitted to gain more that one couple towards the bottom each time they finish the figure, but obliged to gain one couple to preserve the progressive motion of the dance. The progressing movement does not alone belong to the leading couple, but to all persons composing the dance, either moving a couple up or down as all the couples going down the dance progressively gain a couple towards the bottom every time the figure is performed, and all the other couples forming the set will at the same time progressively move up a couple towards the top of the dance, so that the whole of the couples in the set change this situation every time the figure is performed. As soon as the top couple cat form a minor set, that is, as soon as the leading couple or couples going down the dance have gone down three couples, or performed the figure three ties, then the couple left at the top of the general set, or of any minor set, must commence. When it relates to the general set, only then each couple will, according as they stand in rotation in the dance, become successively the top couple, and so on till all the couples forming the set have in succession (what is termed) "gone down the dance", and the couple that stood at the bottom at the beginning of the dance, has progressively "worked up" to the top, and afterwards gone down three couple; that the couple called the dance begin again, and go down within three couples of the bottom, which will finish the dance. The couple that called the dance stand at the bottom for the next dance.

### Country dance figures

Are of different form and length, and take the dancer in various directions (shown by the diagrams in "The complete system of English country dancing"), before they can be of use in the systematic composition of a dance, the length of all the individual figures must be shown, and their application to the music, and also the different between long and short figures.

### Long and short figures

For the convenience of the dancer in the application of the figures to the music, and for setting country dance figures, all the different figures, as fas as regards their length, are brought under two heads, "long" and "short figures"; of which there are several qualities enumerated and treated on under their respective heads.

### Long figures

Are so named, from their requiring to their performance a strain of music of eight bars, which is the longest that should be used in English country dances (videlicet the article "Strains"): they are the longest also that can be applied to the use of the tables for the systematic composition of figures. Long figures are adapted for different uses in the dance, and receive additional names from the different situations in which they are performed in the dance; shown in "The complete system of English country dancing" in the article long figures, performed at top, in the centre, and at bottom of any minor set and long progressive figures. They are as nearly as possible of the same length, and occupy the same time in their performance, whether wholly composed of figure or movement, or whether a post consists of "setting", as, for instance, "hey on your sides" consists entirely of figure movement; and "set and change sides" of half figure and half setting, yet both are performed in the same time. When a dance is wholly composed of long figures, a figure is required to each strain of eight bars, as a tune of three strains with eight bar each, would require three long figures, either with or without setting, as may best suit the nature of the dance, or the taste of the company. Where the figures in this list to which setting is attached as "set and change sides" — "set and half right and left", &c. to be performed without setting, they would require but one half or four bars of the music for their performance, and would then be constituted short figures. Hence arises the impropriety of performing them without setting. While and long figures are deemed the same, though they widely differ from each other (videlicet whole figures). The following are a list of the principle long figures used in English country dancing: as

* Swing corners 
* Turn corners 
* Set contrary corners 
* Lead outsides
* Lead through bottom and top
* Hands six round
* Promenade third couple
* Whole poussette
* Set and change sides and back
* Set and change places and back again
* Set and half right and left and back again
* Round bottom and up
* Round top and bottom
* The hey
* Set three across, and set three in your places
* Cast of two couple, and back again
* Cast over two couple
* Whole figure at top
* Whole figure at bottom
* While figure on your on side
* Chase round two couple
* Chain figure six round
* The three ladies and three gentlemen lead through and back again
* Swing with right hands round the second couple, and back again
* Swing with right hands round two couple
* The first lady turns the second gentleman, the 1st gentleman turns the second lady
* Hands three round with second lady, hands three with second gentleman
* Top lady sets between the second and third ladies
* Hands three round with second lady, who passes under to her place
* Hands three with second gentleman, who passes under to his place
* The double triangle
* The first lady leads down the second gentleman, the first gentleman leads down the second lady
* Lead down the middle and up again, this figure though in reality a short one, has been latterly (by the practice of galloping down a dozen couple, instead of confining its performance to three, the proper limits of every figure in English country dancing) made to require eight bars to its performance instead of four, and consequently converted into a long figure. It will, however, be given in the list of short figures to which class it properly belongs; the foregoing are the principle old country dance figures.

There are some few others, also a variety of new figures composed by the author, and shown by diagrams in "The complete system of English country dancing".

### Double long figures

This class of figures receive their name from their being double or twice the length of those called long figures; as "the three ladies lead round the three gentlemen", and "the thee gentlemen lead round the three ladies"; they require twice the length of music in their performance, videlicet: a stain of eight bars repeated, or two strains played straight through, as they cannot be divided. Some of them require setting, and some are progressive as may be seen by the diagrams in "The system of English country dancing", where their use and applications to the dance are shown.

### Short figures

Are as nearly as possible one half of the length of the long figures, and require to their performance four bars of the music; the half figures are of the same length, but used differently. The names of the principle short figures are given in the following list in which the half figures are included. The manner in which they are used, and the direction they take in the dance may be seen by the diagrams and classes of figures for the use of the tables for composing country dances, in "The complete system of English country dancing". When these figures are applied, two are substituted for a long one, which are frequently applied to give variety and complexity to the dance. Short and half figures were formerly very much used in the composition of dances. In the old dance books many dances are composed wholly or nearly so, of short and half figures, to render the dances complex and difficult in their performance. These figures may be applied either at the top, bottom, or in the centre, of a minor set. Short figures, although only half the length of long figures, are perfect (with the exception of short progressive figures) ending where they begin, and have no setting attached to them. Some "half figures" have setting attached to them; and in this respect differ from short figures (videlicet "Half figures"). A dance may be composed wholly of short figures videlicet the dance entitled the "Caledonian rant", contained in the "Companion to the ball room", composed of four short figures. Formerly, when proper steps were not generally applied to the performance of the figure, it was the custom to divide and sub-divide figures; but to ender them systematically applicable to the strains of country dance music, only one division has been made; this the long or whole figures require a strain of eight bars; and the short or half require only four bars, or half a strain. The following list is a list of the principle short figures: as,

* Allemande
* Right and left
* Turn your partner
* Hands four round
* Half poussette
* Swing round your partner
* Lead through the bottom
* Lead through the top
* Cross over one couple
* Round the bottom
* Round the top
* Hands across half round
* Lead down the middle and up again
* Swing round one couple
* Cast off one couple
* The three gentlemen turn the three ladies
* And chase round one couple.

### Whole figures

The terms "whole" and "long figures" are generally confused with each other, having been considered as the same; though they have quire a different meaning, there being short whole figures, and long whole figures. The term "whole figure" does not relate to the length of the figure so names, but to their being themselves finished, perfect, and indivisible, beginning and ending in the same place. These figures are of different length: "whole figure at top" requires double the music for its performance to either "allemande" or "turn your partner"; yet they are all whole figures. The last-mentioned figures are always arranged in the class of short figures; although they might be termed while figures, as they are perfect in themselves. Head a great many of the short figures been classed with those under the head long figures (except the progressive ones which are an exception to this rile, as they should always be considered as long and short, not ending where they begin, although "whole", and "half poussette" hear a different name), they might together have been termed "whole figures". To prevent as much as possible any confusion calculated to mislead the dancer, and the different figures are separated in "The Complete System of English Country Dancing".

### Half figures

Are portions of certain long or whole figures divided into halves, and followed by a different figure, instead of completing the long or whole figure, and are therefore names "half figures". Those long figures are taken,and generally termed whole figures, and may be danced as "whole or perfect figures", or divided into half figures, at the pleasure of the dancer; there being whole figures at top, bottom, on your own sides, and half figures, bearing the same names formed out of them: they are generally applied to five variety and complexity to the dance in their performance; as they leave the dancer on the wrong side, they must be followed by some other half or short figure to bring the dancers back again to their own sides; but their uses are fully explained in the class of irregular figures to which they belong (in "The complete system of English country dancing"). The same time is required in their performance as in the short figures, videlicet a strain of short measure unrepeated, or half a strain of eight bars.

### Progressive figures

Are those figures which in their performance leave the dancers or leading couples in the second couples place, every time the figure of the dance is finished; see the plate of the "Progressive motion of a country dance" in "The system of English country dancing",and the article "Motion and progression of the dance". They derived their names from the progressive movement towards the bottom of the dance, by bringing the top or leading couple in the place of the second couples every time one of these figures is performed in any minor set, and which progressive movement of the top or leading couple bring the second couple into, or to occupy the place of the top couple. Thus it will be seen that every dance must have at least one progressive figure to take each couple in regular succession to the bottom of the dance, to enable the couples placed at the bottom gradually to move up the couple that commenced it, although one progressive figure is sufficient for the correct performance of any English country dance, yet dances may be composed of two or even three progressive figures (see "The complete system of English country dancing", p. 232), though it very rarely occurs that more than one figure of this description is used. These are a very indispensable class of figures, as no dance can be performed without one, either short or long. They are always performed from or at the top of a minor set, but never bring the dancer back to the place from which they are taken — they are therefore called progressive figures, their performance bringing the top couple progressively to the bottom of the dance by gaining a couple every time the figure is performed; thus in a set of twenty couples, nineteen progressive figures must be performed to bring every top couple in the general set to the bottom of the dance. There are fewer progressive figures that of any other class; the following progressive figures, they are as follows:

* Swing with right hands round second couple, then with left
* Swing with right hands top and centre
* Lead down the middle and up again
* Whole poussette
* Swing round one couple
* Cast off one couple
* Set and change places with second couple

The length of these figures, and the directions they make in the dance may be seen in "The complete system of English country dancing", by the diagrams and classes of figures for the use of the tables.

### Irregular figures

Are those figures that in their application to the dance either leave the performer on the wrong or opposite side, or below the third or bottom couple of a minor set. They are of different length: some have setting attached to them, and some are progressive figures; their length, uses, and properties are explained in "The complete system of English country dancing",

### Figures with setting attached to them

Those figures to which setting is attached, derive their name partly from the movement, and partly from the setting, the setting is generally mentioned first: as "set and change sides" — "set contrary corners" — "set and half right an left", &c. The figure employs but half the time allowed in the music, and the setting the other half.

### Of joining or connecting figures

The uses, names, and characters used, and relative to a minor set, and the method of performing each individual figure, with their length, &c. as applied to the different parts of the dance and to the music, being known to the learner, he will be able to join and connect figures together so as to form a dance. The smallest number of figures that can be employed in the formation of a dance is two. The quantity of figures either in length or number, depends on the music to which they are set; the number of figures is governed by the number of bars or stains of the music (videlicet the scheme  showing the number of figures that may be set to any tune adapted to country dancing, videlicet p. 178). Single or double figures depend on whether the strains of the music are played once or repeated, and how many times repeated, videlicet p. 177. Treble figures may be set by repeating the strains or by playing them straight through. When short or half figures are set to strains of eight bars long measure, great attention must be paid to the playing of the music, two being required to one strain, one of which must end and the other begin in the middle of the strain; and frequently where there is little or no accent in the music to guide the dancer; the time  must however be kept, and the figures joined together on the proper note, without any hesitation or innovation on the time. Short measure (that is strain of four bars repeated) is better adapted to short or half figures, as the figures end with the strain. A perfect knowledge must be had of the beginning and ending of every strain, and their number, to enable the learner properly to begin, end, and join figures in time and place, also of what figures every dance requires, or will admit of, either long or short, and how to blend them together, so as to produce either short or easy, long or complex, single or double figures, to suit trait own taste, or to accommodate the talent of the company. There is no resting in the dance for the leading couple, till they get to the bottom, and the music is the only guide for the beginning and ending of every individual figure, as well as to the figure of the dance; however great a number of individual figures it may contain, they must all be united and connected together, so as to lose the appearance of many parts being connected, and product that of one true mathematical figure. A knowledge of the steps and their divisions, applicable to the music, is also necessary to be known and attended to.

### Long and short measure

Are terms the author has adopted to regulate the length of the strains, as applying to English country dance music, in order to ascertain whet quantity of music is contained in each strain or tune, as to length and number of bars; the whole of the tunes applicable to English country dancing, according to the present system, are brought under two heads, long and short measure, the long containing eight full bars of music, the short containing but four full bars of music; stains have been thus regulated, in order to render them systematically applicable to the various classes of figures, which are also classed and divided into suitable lengths, to correspond with those measures, and which when well understood, will enable the dancer with a knowledge of the number and repetitions of the strains, and with the use of the tables, in "The system of English country dancing" not only to ascertain correctly how many figures any dance will require, but of what length, quality, and different variety dances may be composed; also to ascertain how many figures long or short any dance may contain. See the article entitled "The number of figures possible to be set to any country dance tune".

, is used to divide one part of a figure from the rest, and to point out to the dancer how much figure is to be performed to each strain of the music, first having but one dot, denotes, that the strain belonging to that part of the figure to which it is set is to be played but once; the second having two dots, shows the strains to be repeated or played twice. The figure or figures placed before each strain of the music to which the figure-bar refers.The first bar relates to the first strain, the second the the second strain, and so on to the rest. In order to point out the division of the figure and music more clearly,the author has in his own works, when da capo occurs in short measure, divided the figure, by placing a bar with a single dot at the end of the capo strain, besides that which would naturally occur at the end of the capo, as in "The haunted tower", and "La belle Catherine" (see "Companion to the ball room"), because it cannot be considered like the first, a strain repeated, being in reality two different strains. The dots to divide these strains are always placed at the top of the bar, those to all others, whether in long or short measure, are always placed under the bar.

### Figure of the dance

Although every country dance is composed of a number of individual figures, which may consist of 

* set and change sides,
* whole figure at top,
* lead down the middle, and up again,
* allemande,
* lead through the bottom,
* right and left at top,

&c. yet the whole movement united is called the figure of the dance. The number and length of the various individual figures depend on the length of the music, the smallest number is two, and the greatest number is sixteen. The scheme at page 178, will show what number of long or short figures can be used to all country dance tunes, of whatever length or measure.

### Stains or parts

A strain is that part of an air terminator by a double bar, and usually consists in country dances, of four, eight, or sixteen single bars; sometimes it contains twelve bars. In cotillons, we find occasionally strains of six bars; but this latter strain is extremely unfit for a country dance figure. Country dance tunes usually consist of two strains, though they frequently called parts, by those who are unacquainted with music; as, for instance, by a tune of two parts, they mean one of two strains. Part are only the arrangement of some air for different instruments, as the horn part, the trumpet part, &c. and have no relation to strains whatever. In some airs, particularly Scottish, the last strain will frequently extend to sixteen bars in long measure; but in reality, it is only eight bars repeated, with a small alteration in the last, or two last bars of the last strain, which has been written thus, for the sake of variety in the composition. While the regularity of figure at present established is adhered to, eight bars is the greatest length to which any strain can with propriety be extended, as long figures require no more. Some strains, as have been mentioned before, contain sixteen bars, without a division, as the "Caledonian laddie" (see "Companion to the ball room"), for instance, which of course require two long figures; the author has therefore, throughout his works placed a bar with s single dot, showing the dancer the middle of the strain, to denote the quantity of figure necessary to be performed in the first eight bars, so dividing it for the convenience of the dancer, as if it were two strains of eight bar each. He has equally taken this precaution in short measure, when a strain of sixteen bars occurs, and where he considered the dancer required a guide, as much as in the article "Long measure". See the article "Long and short measure" in "The complete system of English country dancing".

### The length of strains used in country dance music

The length of strains in country dance music seems never to have been attended to, either by composers, dances, or those who set the figures to the tunes, not has any thing systematic ever been adopted for their regulation, this is one of the reasons why figures are so irregularly performed, ans so litter understood. Numberless tunes formerly used, may be found not only containing strains of various lengths, but consisting of an odd number of bars, these dances could only be performed by the introduction of such pantomimical absurdities, as were formerly introduces in the old country dances (see the ancient and original state and style of English country dancing in "The complete system of English country dancing". As no regular figures could be set to them with any certainty, notwithstanding country dancing has since become more regular, and tunes containing an odd number of bars have been rejected, yet there are frequently found tunes containing strains of a variety of lengths, better calculated to puzzle that direct the dancer, some are so long as to reader it difficult, during its performance to divide the tunes exactly in the middle, when there is no sensible accent or signal to guide the ear, until the terminations of the strain. Formerly some well-known country dances contained twelve, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty four, thirty two bars in a strain &c. Now since figures are systematically divided into different length and classes, it has been found requisite also to adopt suitable length and measures in the music, to make them correspond; as there, with regard to length, are reduced to two classes, as long and short figures, therefore the terms long and short measure, are terms the author has adopted in the music, to correspond with those figures. The irregular length of strains as the result of composers not being dancers themselves, in which case they would have seen the propriety of not extending their strains beyond eight bars, which would have rendered their compositions more useful to dancers, suitable to the figures, and convenient to musicians, by an uniform length of strains. All tunes not corresponding with these regular measures, should either be rejected, or if given, should be accompanied with suitable directions for their performance; the length of these strains in long or short measure, will be found under their respective heads, in "The complete system of English country dancing". There are some persons who imaging that a strain of country dance music consists uniformly of eight bars, that is incorrect, although it ought to be so to suit the figures, yes there are many to be found consisting of sixteen bars, and other of only found, for although they are generally the case formally, would totally exclude all single figures, from tines with eight bars in a strain in long measure, see next article, "Single and double figures".

### Single and double figures

Are terms used to express the quantity of figure required in a country dance; and these depend invariable on the respective air to which they are danced. A single figure us the smallest quantity of figure that can possible be selected in one portion (or according to the usual term, set) to the tune; single figures can only be performed to short measure repeated, or to strains of long measure not repeated. To constitute what is termed a double figure, several figures must be placed together equal to twice the number of quantity required for a single figure; and the music, to admit of a double figure, will require the strains of eight bars to be repeated, and the strains of four bars to be played twice through with repeats.

### The number of figures possible to be set to any country dance tune either long or short

Every country dance is composed of several different figures, teen, the usual number are from three to eight; the following scheme will show what number of long and short figures can  possibly be set to all the country dance tunes, by which it will be also seen that every tune will take as many long, and twice as many short figures as there are strain in the music. The length of strains alluded to, are those of eight bars unrepeated, or if four bars repeated, which is the proper length for English country dances.

* Tunes of sixteen bars composed of two strains of eight bars each, with single figures, may have set to them two long figures, or one long and two short, of four short figures.
* Tunes with three strains or two strains, and da capo, with single figures, may have set to them three long figures, or two long figures and two short, or one long and four short, or six short figures,
* Tunes with four strains or thirty two bars with single figures, may have set to them four long figures, or three long and two short, or two long and four short, or one ling and six short, or eight short.
* Tunes of four strains of eight bars each repeated, with double figures, may have set to them four long figures, or three long figures and two short, or two long and two long and four short, or one long and six short, or eight short.
* Tunes of three strains repeated, or two strains and da capo played twice thought with double figures, may have set to them six long figures, or give long and two short, or four long an four short, or three long and six short, or two long and eight short, or one long and ten short, or twelve short figures.
* Tunes containing sixty four bars, composed of four strains repeated, or of three strains an da capo played twice straight through with double figures, may have set to them eight long figures, or seven long and two short, or six long and four short, or three long and ten short, or two long and twelve short, on one long and fourteen short, or sixteen short figures.
* Tunes of four strains and da capo with single figures, may have set to them five long figures, or four long figures and two short, or three long and four short, or two long and six short, or one long and eight short, or ten short figures.

### Country dance music

Country dances are performed to tunes of various length, divided into strains or parts, by upright double bars, thus ||, and when the strain is repeated, two dots are added thus :||:. These usual numbers being gour, eight, and sometimes sixteen bars, which is the greatest number, and sometimes for the sake of variety in the composition of the music, instead of repeating a strain of eight bars, the whole sixteen will be written straight through, this is sometimes done for the purpose of introducing a small alteration in the last, or two last bars, when this is the case, it generally occurs in the last strain of a tune, and may frequently be found in old Scotch tunes. A tune may sometimes be found to contain a strain with twelve bars, which measure is now seldom used. The strains in country dance tunes ought never to contain more that eight bars each, although, as has been before observed, sixteen bars are frequently written straight through, instead of repeating the strain of eight bars, and yet where this is the case, so near is it in reality to a repetition of eight bars, that with the exception of a few notes in the last, or two last bars, the music is note for note the same , and notwithstanding that many tunes are to be found particularly in the old country dance books, which contain a much greater number of bars in each strain, they must be never taken as authorities, as no dependence whatever can be placed in them, most of them having originally been songs, and introduced into country dance books, by persons totally unacquainted with the system of English country dancing. For a further elucidation of this subject, the the articles "Length of strains" and "Stains or parts".

### Da capo

When it occurs, signifies that the tine to which it is attached ends with the first strain, and is used as a reference to prevent the trouble of writing the strain again, and thus an air of two strains of eight bars each, that is in long measure, with da capo attached to it, consists really of three strains, and a tune of three strains and da capo is equal to four strains. In short measure it seldom makes any addition to the length of tune, as the first strain is usually played twice, the second but once, and then the da cope or first strains again, which together make but four short strains, which would be so without the da capo, as in the case the second strain would necessarily be repeated.

### Progressive movements

Of "Lead down and up again", — "Whole poussette", — "Swing with the right hand round one couple", &c. when performed, attention to the music is necessary, as the couples must move up the the leading couple's place, as they progressively move down, to keep the proper distance between the couples, and give the leading couple room to perform the succeeding figures, or to commence the dance again.

### Of selecting figures, and applying the to the dance

In the selecting of figures for the composition of English country dances, it is necessary that a knowledge should be had of their various effects in the dance, notwithstanding that many of them are of the same length, and performed from the same situation, an though directed at or from the top, are yet not so well adapted to the commencement of the dance: it is the same with figures adapted to the conclusion of the dance. Care should be taken not to choose all such figures as bear too great a similarity in appearance to each other, either in form or effect, or such figures that only employ the leading couple (unless there be particular reason) the other couples being consequently unemployed, render it irksome to them, particularly if the set be numerous. One reason for their being introduced has been that the company generally being bad dancers, and not understanding figures, they have been chosen, to enable couple calling the dance to display their abilities; and by thus preventing confusion in the dance, have been in no danger of having their exclusive evolutions broken into, or spoiled, though the inability of others, they being little more that silent spectators. When a company consists of tolerably good dancers, they should be so united as to give activity and employment to the company, according to the length of the music. A dance ought not to be wholly composed of circular figures as they tend to excite giddiness in the dancers, and produce a sameness of appearance. When a dance is intended to be rendered difficult and complex, let it be composed principally of short or half figures, set to tunes in long measure; there being little or no accent in this measure for the direction of the joining of the figures. To enable good dancers to display their abilities, choose principally those figures, which bad dancers most fear, as they seldom have any steps properly adapted thereto. Slow music also tends to expose bad dancers. The most difficult figures for indifferent dancers to perform are

* right and left,
* set and half right and left,
* chain figure six round, and
* four round,
* swing right hand round one couple, then with the left,
* set contrary corners, &c. &c.

Therefore, when a dance is called to be performed amongst indifferent dancers, such figures ought to be avoided, to prevent confusion. Double, and even treble figures, should be practised by the learner; but not called, unless in companies of good dancers. In selecting the figures for a dance, it is not advisable to take too many from one class, or of those performed from one situation; but to take some from each, and give them as much variety as the length of the tune and the talent of the company will admit.

### Of the performing figures within their proper compass

As three couples constitute a country dance, as to number of persons, the figures are so composed as to be kept within their distance of standing. A great error, committed by many persons, particularly to be avoided, is, that a couple in "going down the middle", and in "cast off two couple", instead of confining themselves to the distance of three couple, frequently extend the figures beyond six couples, and consequently interfere with the preceding couples.

### Persons calling the dance

Should possess the necessary requisites for performing the duty they may have to execute, in setting the company an example, and dire ting them (when required) in the performance of the dance. Such a dance should be called, as they thoroughly understand, and are able to perform with facility. When part of the company are indifferent dancers, the persons forming the dance should be selected and placed according to their talent and knowledge of dancing; the best couples at and near the top, that by their performance the others may become instructed in the figure, previous to their having to lead off, otherwise it frequently happens, that the dance is obliged to be changed.

### Silence in the dance

Should invariably be observed; but it too frequently occurs, that one half of the persons composing the dance are in conversations on subjects generally unconnected with the dance; their attention so frequently required, not only thereby becomes diverted, but the music, which is the guide for the dancer, is prevented from being distinctly heard.

### Crowding to the top

Is too frequently practised, but should be prevented by those whose province it may be to see that due respect is paid to the person calling the dance; it being impossible to perform the figure of the dance with effect, or correctly, when the couples stand to near to each other.

### Attention to the figure

While the figure is performing, it is requisite for every person in the dance to observe, whether any of the figures require their attention and assistance for their correct performance, and what number of couples they may require; otherwise, for want of proper attentions, part of the music becomes lost, and the music and figure cannot then be finished together without much bustle, as the music must not wait on the dancers, but the dancers perform the figures and steps as properly adapted thereto.

### Finishing the figures in their proper places

Whatever figure is performed, it should be finished in its proper place before another is commenced; the regularity of the dance must otherwise be completely destroyed. The progressive figures should be finished in the centre; and those at top, &c. that bring the dancer back to the same place, should finish in the straight line with the other couples, always observing to finish the figure with the last note of the music.

### Paradoxical observations

For the purpose of blending amusement with instruction, and to facilitate the learner's acquirement of something more that a superficial knowledge of country dancing, as well as to convince those persons of the error who hold country dancing as simple trifling art, very easily attainable, the following positions are laid down, to show the nature, extent, and variety, of which country dancing consists, though to some persons, particularly to learners, they may appear paradoxical; yes they are self-evident truth, capable of being clearly explained by good dancers, and rendered easily demonstrable, by an attention to those parts of the work on country dancing, to which they more immediately relate.

> The tracks or figures are named short and long:
>
> To these denominations all belong,
>
> And they are in six different classes formed,
>
> Which show their use and how they are performed.
>
> Irregular figures too you'll likewise find,
>
> And some have setting steps with them combined,
>
> No correct knowledge of them can be gained,
>
> Unless they are by diagrams explained;
>
> There's whole, and half figures, but then you'll find,
>
> From length some whole are with the short combined;
>
> Single and double figures must be known,
>
> Their uses and construction clearly shown
>
> There you compose know every figures use,
>
> Their evolutions, simple or abstruse,
>
> And must know how such figures to select,
>
> As give the dances interest and effect,
>
> There you can dances make, you ought to show;
>
> With dancing you a little music know:
>
> And what are meant by bars, strains, and da capo,
>
> Long and short measure, and the times that they
>
> Should all the various country dances play.
>
> And tell what figures every tune will suit;
>
> And know how short for long, to substitute;
>
> The figure of the dance, and figure bar,
>
> You must explain, and know like evening star;
>
> And likewise know what figures to select,
>
> To give the dances interest and effect.
>
> There's some abuses dancers need reform,
>
> And duties they to others should perform
>
> As knowing how to soit the dance to those
>
> Capacities who may the dance compose;
>
> The keeping silence in the dance, that they
>
> May hear the music; — and attention pay
>
> To every figure in the dance, or where
>
> Each figure ends; and how each wants their care,
>
> Watch the progressive motion of the dance,
>
> Know when to move, retire, or advance;
>
> The crowding to the top you should avoid,
>
> And know how every dancer is employed;
>
> When in the set, at proper distance stand,
>
> That all may see and clearly understand
>
> What evolutions every figure makes,
>
> And what direction every dancer takes.
>
> In leading down, you should know where to stop,
>
> And mind you're skilled before you take the top,
>
> With other matters I could here advance,
>
> There you can dance the English country dance:
>
> I mean to dance it scientifically,
>
> And understand it systematically.
>
> There's other terms and technicalities,
>
> And characters with figures and their qualities,
>
> Which must be known with proper steps, and they
>
> When they're performed, must ease and grace display;
>
> Till this is done, no persons showed advance,
>
> That they well understand a country dance.
>
> Some day by way of paradox, I'll show,
>
> What may be done and what you ought to know;
>
> Which when explained, I have no doubt, you'll own,
>
> That English country dancing's little known.

### Enter musicians and children.

> Here come some children, and the music too,
>
> They will assist in what we're going to do;
>
> They'll help to form a set — with six you know,
>
> We then through any country dance can go.
>
> Jem. Now for a Country Dance, a set we'll make,
>
> I for my partner, will miss Coupée take.
>
> Play us "The Merry Thought", although not new,
>
> It will bring reflection strange, and pleasant too;
>
> It will what they call a merry sprightly air,
>
> It will raise the spirits, also banish care.
>
> Bel. Let's have it by all means, for you must know,
>
> My spark's base conduct's made me very low.
>
> We are ready, sirs, it is time we have begun.
>
> Jem. Stop, sirs — we, for a country dance want one,
>
> And one who through a threesome reel can go.
>
> Bel. Then there's your aunt miss Biddy Frump below,
>
> Who's fond of dancing; and she often says,
>
> She once was at a ball two nights and days,
>
> Danced out three pair of shoes at that great ball;
>
> That fifty couples stood up to her call:
>
> Danced "Money Musk", "Cheshire Rounds", "Scotch Contention",
>
> And many more hard figures she does mention.
>
> There's nothing like them now, you'll hear her say,
>
> She's so conceited in her formal way.
>
> Jem. She's what we want, and dances just like those
>
> Pretenders we are going to expose.
>
> Some lessons in quadrilles and waltzing, she
>
> Once took, when courted by young Mister B.;
>
> She lost her lover at a grand waltz ball,
>
> So now hates modern dances, one and all.
>
> Betwixt you and me, her imitations are
>
> True pictures, for she's got them to a hair;
>
> We'll let her give the reel in her own way,
>
> And stand up merely to perform the hey;
>
> She's stiff and formal, sails along like those
>
> Stiff joint-less puppets, seen at penny shows.
>
> Her steps, her style, her manner now displays,
>
> What ball-room dancers were in former days;
>
> I won't say all, but many I well know,
>
> Dance like her, who learnt fifty years ago.
>
> I'll call her up — it will please her to a hair;
>
> She'll be delighted in a dance to share.

### Exit Jemima.

### To the musicians.

> Bel. Now, gentleman, I have one request to make,
>
> That when miss Frump comes in, no heed you'll take
>
> Of her, or of her dress, or her odd way,
>
> Nor how she dances, nor of what she says —
>
> She's rather formal, which her dress will tell,
>
> Miss Biddy Frump's no Cranbourn Alley belle.

### Enter Miss Frump and Jemima.

> Miss Frump. Hey day! what have we music here? that's right,
>
> I am overjoyed; we'll have a dance to night.
>
> Jem. By all means aunt — for that I came to you;
>
> You now can help us out in something new.
>
> Miss Frump. I'll join in any thing, country dance or reel,
>
> Can beat my steps, with either toe or heel;
>
> Can run the hey — can figure out or in.
>
> Bel. It is growing late — Jemima, let's begin.
>
> Jem. You know its ball night, aunt, and ten to one,
>
> Had it not rained, before this weed begun.
>
> Miss Frump. My toes are itching to begin; now say
>
> What it shall be, and bid the music play.
>
> Jem. I should have told you aunt, that we propose
>
> To give some imitations, here of those
>
> New fangled dances, waltzes and quadrilles,
>
> And those queer modern dancing Jacks and Jills.
>
> Miss Frump. You may say Jacks and Jills, for such queer guests
>
> I never saw, as ball rooms now infest.
>
> If I could see them well exposed, it would be
>
> The greatest pleasure you could give to me;
>
> I shall be happy to make one, and show
>
> That I the antics of these gentry know.
>
> Bel. We'll now begin; here are miss Frump and I,
>
> Who will the leading couple now supply.
>
> Jem. Play the dance I mentioned, sirs, rather slow;
>
> Musicians. I fear miss, we that dance don't rightly know.
>
> Miss Frump (to Jemima). What is the true? Have you the music brought?
>
> Jem. It is you old favourite, aunt "The Merry Thought".
>
> Miss Frump. A charming tune "The Merry Thought" I love;
>
> If it's well played, ah! that will make you move.
>
> I'm for a merry tune; at our last ball,
>
> I "Buttered Peas" and "Jack's Alive" did call.
>
> Jem. If you don't recollect "The Merry Thought", now play
>
> The last new tune, called "Buxom, Young, and Gay".
>
> We're ready, sirs — three chords, and then begin;
>
> Come to your places, children — now stand in.
>
> Bel. Dance as you've just described them, then it will be
>
> Instruction and amusement both for me.
>
> Miss Frump. I'll show you how I have seen some sorry fops,
>
> Dance country dances, at your modern hops.

### They dance.

> Bel. This is just like them, and I wish these elves
>
> Could only see what fools they make themselves;
>
> Instead of country dancing, I am quite sure,
>
> Foreigners would call such stuff a caricature.
>
> Jem. To see them dance, it would never be supposed
>
> The dance was on true principles composed;
>
> So unlike mathematic rules they go,
>
> From what they do, a stranger scarce would know
>
> The middle or beginning, or intent
>
> Of those who dance, or what is really meant;
>
> And what's still more, the time they seldom keep,
>
> Some run the figures — others through them creep

This and the other following figures are described by diagrams in "The quadrille panorama". In describing these terms where the English translation is not litera, the technical meaning is given.	
	
* Promenade — The gentleman and lady cross hands, the gentleman with his right hand takes the lady's right, and with his left, takes her left hand and leads her round in a circle; there are several promenades, (videlicet) grand promenade, whole promenade, and half promenade
* Balancez — Set
* Grand chaine — Great chain
* Dos à dos — Back to back
* Les lignes — The lines
* Grand rond — Great round
* Traversez — Cross over
* Tour de mains — Turn your partner with both hands
* Chassez croissez — Chassez across, change places
* Queue du chat — Promenade
* Grand quarrée — The great squares
* Moulinet — Cross hands
* Chaine de dames — Ladies chain
* Tiroir — The top couple join both hands and take the place of the bottom couple, who pass sideways into the top couple's place — then the bottom couple join both hands, and pass between the top couple — all return to places
* Chassez ouvert — Open chassez
* Chassez en avant, et en arrière — Chassez forward and backward
* Chaine anglaise — English chain
* Les olivettes — The hey
* L'étoile — The star
* Poussette — Is formed by two couples: each gentleman takes the opposite lady's hand, and they then move round each other to places

The above terms are, it is presumed,sufficiently correct for the purpose of this work, though perhaps not secure against the observations of the critical French scholar. The want of accents in some instances, will not, it is hoped, be too minutely noticed by the liberal reader, who will bear in mind the only object of the author, videlicet to give an English explanation of the French terms, in general use, in quadrille dancing.

### Long and short sets

When these terms are used in quadrille dancing, they allude to the number of dances in the set; a long set generally consists of six, and a short set is usually of five. The first is considered a short set, and when la pastourelle is add, it is then termed a long set. A short set consists not only of a smaller number of quadrilles, but various figures are omitted in certain quadrilles, as the ladies chain in trenise, and the finale, is likewise abridged.

### Trenise simple

Is when the trenise figure is performed without the chaine des dames.

### The gavotte quadrille

The honours to first strain of minuet de la cour.

The top and bottom couples set opposite to each other à la gavotte — eight bars.

Side couples do the same — eight bars.

Set to partners, giving the right and left hands alternately, and go round your partners on the right to places — twelve bars.

Each gentleman gives his right hand to the lady on the left, and his left alternately to his partner, then pass round with the lady on the right — twelve bars.

Top and bottom couples advance twice with pas de basque, and retire with emboitées — eight bars.

The side couples do the same — eight bars.

Top and bottom ladies advance round each other à la gavotte — twelve bars.

The ladies on the sides do the same - twelve bars.

Top and bottom couples set opposite each other as in figure 1, while the side couples chassez croissez — eight bars.

Vice versa — eight bars.

Pas de quatre four ladies — twelve bars.

Each gentleman takes his partner's left hand and moves completely round to places with grand balloté; jetée back, and coupée entrechat à la fin.

The author of this work will always feel it is duty to expose and reprobate all mean attempts al literary piracy and plagiarism, whether affecting his own compositions or those of others.

### Waiting eight bars

The set being formed, the dancers should wait the first eight bars, and begin the dance with the second strains, if the first is not repeated, this interval of time should be filled up with the performances of the honours. To every quadrille in the set they should wait the first eight bars.

### The honours (i. e.) the bow and courtesy

In quadrille dancing these honours should always be made to your partner and the opposite, and to the first eight bars if music, before you begin the figure. The honours should not only be made at the commencement of each set, but likewise of each individual quadrilles, however many there may be in a set, and also at the conclusion of every set, and finally by every gentleman when he has led his partner to her seat.

### Positions of the dancers in quadrilles composed of four, eight, twelve, and sixteen persons

Figure omitted.

Some teachers call the bottom the second couple, and the couple on the right of the leading couple, the third couple, but the usual method is to reckon numerically round on the right of the top couple, as shown in the diagram for eight persons.

### Direction for performing the quadrilles.

In sets composed of eight persons (see figure 1) the first and third couples generally dance together, as do the sends and fourth. When the figure begins with two persons, as in l'été, is it performed with the first lady and third gentleman, then with the first gentleman and third lady, then the second lady and fourth gentleman, and is finished with the second gentleman and fourth lady. Is a quadrille of twelve (see figure 2) when the first and fourth couple have performed the danse... *Text incomplete here*.

> For when the first set's called, musicians say
>
> Thus to each other, "Now what shall we play?"
>
> For practice or to please some leading crotchet,
>
> They something new select and mostly botch it:

> Musicians will too oft, to show their skill,
>
> Play strange new sets, but then perform them ill.
>
> Bel. Many of those new sets are very bad,
>
> If tried by rule only notes run mad:
>
> This makes the dancers curse these innovations,
>
> And scratch their ears to hear such mutilations;
>
> And with (for tune and time, not tuneless noise),

> Would suit the dance, and dancers satisfy.
>

> And if they cannot, should renounce the bow.
>

>
> Jem. For half the sets the music is selected,

>
> Quadrilles our ball room music have improved,
>

>
> Bel. Besides those new quadrilles composed in France,
>
> What other sets in public do they dance?
>
> Jem. The Lancers and Der Freichutz stand confessed

>
> In their construction they have boldly stated,
>
> The rules of art have all been violated.
>
> The Lancers is a figure dance, they say,
>
> In which no dancers can their skill display,
>
> A sort of heterogeneous children's play.
>
> Ability and steps are not required,
>
> To dance those Lancers now so much admired.
>
> Bel. They're English Dances I must here admit.
>
> Jem. Foreigners say for Johnny Bull quite fit.
>
> Bel. Be as they may, these dances mostly please,
>
> And what's more cheering may be learnt with ease;
>
> And now are danced by all, both old and young,
>
> The music's prized, the tunes are danced and sung.
>
> Jem. But in "Der Freichutz" figures, there no doubt,

>
> He only has three figures if you look,
>
> The other two from the first set be took;
>
> And those are not perhaps what some expected,
>
> They're from the Lancers and first set selected;
>
> But Freichutz had a name — a name's enough,
>
> To pass off any trite or wretched stuff;
>
> The music of this set, I will engage,
>

>

>
> Composers are not always here to blame,
>

>

>
> From fear or ignorance the thing's opposed;
>
> And if attempted, those stand up to try,
>
> To whom dame Nature did the art deny
>
> To see such dance new sets would drive you crazy,
>
> For some want ears, and some are dull and lazy;
>
> Then fools of all sorts always do (depend)
>
> Find fault with what they do not comprehend;
>
> They're "nasty ugly things" they mostly say,
>
> "Can only he the fashion of the day".
>
> Bel. Yet these declaimers will not hesitate,
>
> To learn that slyly they pretend to hate.
>
> Jem. To make out something new each teacher tries,
>
> And with old figures new quadrilles supplies;
>
> And some have title — if not rational,
>
> To make you think they're really national.
>
> Bel. Whatever is popular is thread-bare worn,
>
> Aye, turned and twisted, and to atoms torn;
>
> To ake it out — its patched and so extended,
>
> And e'en with different colours often mended;
>
> And made as common as the king's highway,
>

>
> (If e'en composers would give them a chance),
>
> And dance quadrilles such as we've seen in France,
>
> Now tell me which quadrilles you think the best.
>
> Jem. The original French first set is now confessed,
>
> For merit to exceed e'en all the rest:
>
> At many places the "First Set", is all
>
> That's danced, or ever asked for at a ball;
>
> Sometimes the second set is used, but they
>
> Do no originality display
>
> For if you look, I think I'm not mistaken,
>
> The three first figures from the first are taken.
>
> The old first set is all that thousands know,
>
> Though they to quadrille balls do constant go;
>
> From them you'll find some hundred sets are made,
>
> Which if not danced, have yet made good for trade;
>
> And many have been used with special care,
>
> In forming dolls and curling ladies hair
>
> Of "Paine's, of Almack's", sixteen sets I'm told,
>
> Or more were published if they were not sold;
>
> Paine's followed the first set, and then were all
>
> The town supplied, or were danced at a ball;
>
> Though in them there's not much variety,
>
> The figures are composed with some propriety
>
> They're French — the tunes have mostly been selected,
>
> Or altered so to hide from whence collected;
>
> To these succeeded sets of every kind,
>
> To nation, style — nor character confined.
>
> Bel. The "Old First Set", I must confess to you,
>
> I never yet throughout correctly knew.
>
> Jem. You'll find this card (gives a card) the figures does contain,
>

>
> With only four, the first set you may dance,
>

>

>
> For sets of four, new figures can't he found,
>
> For greater numbers figures do abound;
>
> Since first the mania for quadrilles existed,
>
> Every old figure has been turned and twisted;
>
> And many figures are fresh named by those
>

>

>

> That talent few professors now display,
>
> They've not from Euclid, or Archimedes,
>
> Drawn their resources to instruct and please;
>
> But from each other, taking it for granted,
>
> They're quite as good and regular as wanted;
>
> And if they're not quite mathematical,
>
> Or are not strictly geometrical;
>
> They're yet what pass for new quadrilles, but they
>
> Can only live and flourish for a day.
>
> Bel. Although I have danced quadrilles, yet I must own,
>
> Their real construction is to me unknown,
>
> As also are the technic terms of art,
>
> Their meaning I must beg you to impart;
>
> The names the figures hear, their qualities,
>
> Their use, and other technicalities,
>
> What length these dances are, and if composed
>
> Scientifically, as it's supposed
>
> What sort of music these quadrilles require,
>
> Their time, their stile, and length, I must enquire.
>
> This knowledge I am anxious to attain;
>
> Jem. These subjects I'll endeavour to explain.
>
> The technic terms of art you well should know,
>
> There you to quadrille balls attempt to go
>
> Learn them by heart, that when you dance, you may
>
> Know what comes next, and be what's termed au fait.
>
> Quadrilles are formed in octagons and squares,
>
> The couples stand quite opposite in pairs;
>
> Each lady on her partner's right they place,
>
> Then opposite a gentleman she'll face.
>
> The top is where the dance begins, and may
>
> If dancers please, be formed a different way;
>
> Four tops and bottoms has each dance in turn,
>
> And how they're made you from this card may learn.
>
> Quadrilles are either 2/4 or 6/8,
>
> From these two times quadrilles all emanate,
>
> And each quadrille's composed as a rondo,
>
> As every tune must end with a da capo;
>
> Figures are long and short; the long will take
>
> Eight bars, when you their evolutions make;
>
> The short require but four, and they may be
>
> Danced in that time, with great propriety.
>
> Bel. How many figures does each dance contain?
>
> Jem. Your card their names and numbers will explain.
>
> The genuine figures have French names you'll find,
>
> Others are mostly of a mongrel kind;
>
> Some of the principal I'll here select,
>
> And give the names of those I recollect.
>
> There's promenade, grand chaine, balancez,
>
> Dos a dos, les lignes, grand rond, traversez,
>
> Chaine des dames, le tiroir, chassez ouvert,
>
> Chassez en avant et en arrière,
>
> Tours de mains, poussette, chassez croissez,
>
> Queue du chat, grand quarrée, moulinet,
>
> Chaine anglaise, les olivettes, l'étoile,
>
> And others I can't now to memory call,
>
> The whole of which you ought to understand,
>
> With proper steps to use at your command;
>
> And not he like some dancers I well know,
>
> Who will stand up, not knowing where to go;
>
> Who have no steps but those taught by their nurses,
>
> Whose partners load them tacitly with curses.
>
> Bel. Tell me the steps you in quadrilles may use,
>
> That I may know their names, and which to choose.
>
> Jem. There's chassez, jeté, assemblée,
>
> Rigaudon, pas de basque, emboitée,
>
> Coupée entrechats, balancez,
>
> Besides the French, for persons, names, and things,
>
> (Which the quadrille in requisition brings)
>
> And situations where the persons stand,
>
> You must have French for, and must understand.
>
> Bel. They now in English the quadrilles explain,
>
> As few who dance can any French attain.
>
> Respecting sets, one thing I must enquire,
>
> How many persons will a set require?
>
> Jem. Of various numbers quadrille sets they make,
>
> As four, eight, twelve, and some sixteen will take;
>
> How to form sets of twelve, likewise sixteen,
>
> And how they act may by the plans be seen.
>
> With 4 the first set you may dance with ease,
>
> Eight's more convenient, and will sooner please;
>
> The usual number's 8 — with those you may
>
> Make every figure, and the dance display.
>
> There's sometimes sets of 12 and 16 formed,
>
> Which in oblique directions are performed.
>
> Bel. I never liked quadrilles performed this way,
>
> To me they seemed confused, I needs must say,
>
> Upon the stage perhaps the plan may be
>
> Resorted to with some propriety.
>
> There all should face the audience if they can,
>
> This to effect, they use the oblique plan;
>
> No such pretence for ball-rooms can I grant,
>
> For there each side's successively a front.
>
> The meaning of a set can you explain?
>
> Does it to dance or persons appertain?
>
> Jem. To call a dance the tune and figure's meant
>
> To make a set the form's to represent,
>
> By persons placed in couples, so that they
>
> The quadrille form may in a square display.
>
> When sets are named, as "the first set", you'll find
>
> To tune and figure then the term's confined.
>
> Bel. There's one thing more I wish you would explain,
>
> How many dances does a set contain?
>
> Jem. A set has five quadrilles, and sometimes six,
>
> But live they as the average number fix;
>
> The last they term "finale", means the end,
>
> To this some extra figure they append.
>
> What's termed short sets are not alone, you'll find,
>
> Unto the number of quadrilles confined,
>
> For in some dances figures are left out,
>
> To suit some shallow memories no doubt;
>
> Or else some idle dancer's whim to please,
>
> As in Finale, and in "La trenise".
>
> Bel. There's short and long finales, I've heard say;
>
> What are they? are they danced a different way?
>
> Jem. A short finale's "Grand rond and L'été",
>
> To make a long one add "Le Moulinet";
>
> A short set's five, a long set six contains,
>
> The figures for these sets your card explains.
>
> Bel. Are those correct, for I've heard people say,
>
> That piracy's the order of the day;
>
> Some dancers from this charge are not exempt,
>
> Who treat fair dealing with a marked contempt,
>
> For what they steal they do not hesitate
>
> To alter, transpose, change, and mutilate.
>
> There's one thing more must be attended to,
>
> But which I trust need scarce be told to you,
>
> When you stand up, don't like some silly elves,
>
> Whose vanity makes them expose themselves,
>
> Attempt to lead till you the dance well know,
>
> But take the side, and you'll know where to go.
>
> From side positions Tyros may discern
>
> The steps with ease, and may the figures learn;
>
> Avoid the bottom too, for that's a place
>
> Where would be dancers oft incur disgrace,
>
> For they act mostly with the top, so they
>
> Should know the dance, and great attention pay,
>
> So take the side till you are quite au fait.
>
> When the Quadrille begins, I here must state,
>
> The first eight bars the dancers always wait;
>
> The honours in that interval should be
>
> Performed — the usual mark of courtesy.
>
> Not the first only, but in every dance,
>
> You wait 8 bars before you should advance,
>
> And in that time the honours should repeat,
>
> And at the end, and ere you take your seat.
>
> Bel. How many bars of music are contained
>
