### The Description of the Polonaise (From "The Court Journal")

This dance is a great favourite in the northern courts, and is of Polish origin; it is in reality merely a dignified and graceful march and is performed by a file of couples, to those charming musical compositions called polonaises, on which the most eminent composers have exercised their talents. This dance possesses the recommendation of being exceedingly social, the couples advance, lightly marking the time with their feet, while they enjoy every opportunity for agreeable conversation, and for displaying without effort the most elegant motion. The only figure which varies this dance is a change of hands, resembling a movement of the minuet, and which requires only to be seen to be easily imitated.

In the polonaise a gentleman by presenting himself at the head of the file, and clapping his hands becomes the partner of the first lady; the gentleman who is thus superseded, takes the hand of the next lady, and so on through all the couples. The last gentleman who is by this means deprived of a partner, either retires, or advances to the head of the dance to lead off in his turn.

### Waltz Cotillon

This dance commences by six or eight couples waltzing round the room, a chair is then introduced into the centre, in which the first gentleman seats his partner. He then leads up and presents each of the other gentlemen in succession. If the lady rejects, the discarded suitor retires behind the chair; but when the “favoured one” arrives, she springs up, the tone and accent of the music are accelerated, and off she waltzes with the elected – the other gentlemen then resume their partners and the circle is continued. All in turn go through the ceremony of presentation. That being concluded, three chairs are then placed, in which a lady (in succession) is seated between two gentlemen, who ardently solicit her reluctant regard, till at length she decides in favour of one, with whom she waltzes off, followed by the other couples, as before. A gentleman is now seated in the centre chair, blindfolded, and a lady takes the place on each side; in this perplexity of choice the Tantalus of the mirth remains, till by a sudden resolution, he decides for right or left, uncovers his eyes, and waltzes away with the chance-directed partner, followed as before. The chairs are now placed triangularly, dos a\ dos, and three ladies are thus seated. The gentlemen pace round them in a circle, till each of the fair ones throws her handkerchief and away they again whirl. The gentlemen then appear to deliver to each, but to one alone is given, a ring, and the dance concludes by the ladies passing hand in hand through arches made by the extended arms of the gentlemen, and each takes his partner and once more waltzes round the circle.

### The Mazurka or Cotillon Russe (From "The Court Journal")

The mazurka is a dance of Polish origin, and was introduced into this country by the duke of Devonshire, the English ambassador to Russia.

The mazurka resembles the quadrille, in so far as it is danced by sets of eight persons, four of either sex, who arrange themselves in couples, the lady in each couple taking the place to the right of the gentleman, and the first and second couple, and the third and fourth couple face each other.

The dance consists of what may be described as twelve different movements, and as in the quadrille, the first eight bars of the music are played before the first movement commences.

The first movement may be considered as preparatory, and has no figure, since it consists merely of a motion from right to left, and then from left to right, by each person, four times repeated. The steps in this first movement are three, and of a character, that at once gives an eccentric air to the dance, and as it were, excites and stirs up a corresponding spirit in those who are engaged in it; they consist of a stamp, a hop, and a sliding step, or glissade.

In the next movement, the leading cavalier describes a circle round each lady, to his right (beginning with his own partner, who accompanies him throughout this movement) and is followed in this by all the party, the step being still the stamp, hop, and glissade. This movement in the course of sixteen bars brings each couple to the spot whence they started.

A movement now commences, which also occupies sixteen bars, and in the course of which, the dancers set to each other with their left shoulders forward, clap the hands once, and assume that pretty and naive attitude, which consists in placing the back of the hands on the hips, and pointing the elbows forward. The next movements include some of those which are well known by their use in dances that have been naturalized in this country, the quadrille and the waltz. These continue till about the middle of the dance, when the chief and most characteristic and striking parts of the movements commence, and which consist in each lady turning first round her partner and successively round every other gentlemen of the set; each couple passing under the raised arms of all the other couples; each gentleman kneeling on one knee, while his partner passes round him, holding his hand; and finally, some of the first movements having been repeated, and the first couple having regained their original place, the first gentleman has the privilege as leader, of moving forward wherever he pleases, (even into a different room,) all the other couples being required to follow, and repeat his movements – "Follow my leader" fashion.
