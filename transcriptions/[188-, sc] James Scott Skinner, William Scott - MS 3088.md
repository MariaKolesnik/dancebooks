### {10} Quadrilles

> A quadrille, a quadrille is a pleasure,
>
> Which they who know not, sure know nought:
>
> 'Tis a pastime beyond every treasure
>
> That mirth, youth, and joy ever bought.

_Anonymous_

The quadrilles are the unbounded favourites of old and young and no wonder. When we see a lady moving softly and smoothly to the voice of melody, her ear feeling every note and her graceful figure gliding in keeping with it, avoiding all laboured steps and rude, vulgar swingin'! (every good, and truly graceful dancer does so), the movements of her feet are but the index to graceful dancing, or musical motion, for the head, neck and body come in for a duo proportion of elegance, proving that “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever”. In our professional duties we have seen ladies, aye, and gentlemen too, give their hands with grace, ease and elegance that made their movements the “poetry of motion”. It has been said “The height of art is to conceal art”. Let this be so. With the above remarks we quote the following from “Analysis of the London Ball-Room”.

Quadrilles are of novel introduction into this country, and we are indebted to the French for their survival, for they approximate {11} so nearly to the dance termed cotillion that design or invention cannot with justice be applied. They are danced in sets of eight, twelve or sixteen persons; but the set of eight is best calculated for displaying the true spirit and the elegant graceful evolutions of this mode of dancing.' As Teachers of Dancing we earnestly hope and trust that the Quadrille may be revived and danced with freedom, chasteness, and graceful ease, and that the “rough and ready” style now in vogue may be viewed as the “Romance of quadrille dancing”.

### Ball-room dances. Quadrilles.

The lady stands on the gentleman's right hand.

### [^1]Paine's first set.
### First figure. Le pantalon.

[^1]: Only dwellers in the “Silver city by the sea” call the “Th' Edinboro' quadrilles”

1. Top and bottom couples right and left.
2. Set (four walking steps to right, four to left), turn partners.
3. Ladies' chain.
4. Half promenade, and half right and left. Side couples do the same.

This figure is performed twice; first by the top and bottom couples, and then by those at the side.

### {12} Second figure. L'ete.

1. First or top lady and opposite gentleman to the right twice: (this is considered an improvement on advance and retire).
2. Cross over five plain steps and at sixth turn the body half round and count 6, 7, 8.
3. Being now vis à vis to each other to the right four plain steps.
4. Return to partners and turn.

Attempts have been made to dance this figure double. Those who do so not only destroy the original figure but add confusion to former arrangements.

L'ete and La poule after it, are performed each four times; both in the following order: first the leading lady and opposite gentleman perform the figure: second, the first gentleman and opposite lady: third, the lady at the right of the top and opposite gentleman; and lastly, the gentleman at the right of the top and opposite lady.

### Third figure. La poule.

1. First lady and opposite gentleman cross over, offering right hands across giving left hands, and fall in a line, set four in a line.
2. Half promenade to opposite places.
3. First lady & gentleman advance twice, at second time the honours {13} at second time the honours of the dance, or in plain terms, [^2]bow and curtsey.
4. Four advance and retire: half right and left.

### Fourth figure. La pastorale.

1. The top couple galop round twice, leave lady on left of opposite gentleman and retire.
2. Three advance and retire, advance a second time and leave ladies with top gentleman.
3. Top gentleman advance and retire twice with ladies.
4. Four hands round in circle to each others places.
5. Right and left to places.

### Fifth figure. La finale.

1. All join hand advance and retire twice to centre of circle.
2. Top and bottom couples advance and retire: galop to each others places.
3. Ladies chain.
4. Top and bottom couples advance and retire: galop to places.

La pastorale and La finale are each repeated four times. Flirtation sometimes used as a sixth figure. As there is no set music for this figure, and no set arrangement we have omitted it.

[^2]: Another reprehensible custom is creeping in videlicet: Instead of doing the honours to your vis-à-vis wheeling round and doing them to partners. This may be new (?) but is neither polite nor politic. Avoid it.

### {14} The lancers

The Lancers are not new but have again become popular in consequence of their elegance and revival at state balls + circles in high life.

### Arrangement for eight

_Each figure 4 time through — beginning after 8 bars of music._

1. First lady and opposite gentleman advance and retire: re-advance, turning each other with hands to places. First couple join hands and lead through third couple. Third couple join hands, and lead through first couple. All set at the corners, and turn to places. This is repeated by all the others.
2. First couple advance and retire. Re-advance, gentleman leaving partner in centre (facing him). The set and turn to places. Sides part and form two lines at top and bottom. All join hands, advance, and retire, and turn partners to places. The whole of the above is repeated by the other couples, in order 3, 2, and 4, but 2 and 4 form the lines at sides.
3. The ladies advance and retire; re-advance, gentlemen meanwhile join hands: ladies curtsey, and pass backwards under the gentleman's arms. Each lady places hands on gentleman hands; and all galop round to the left to places. Gentlemen advance and retire; re-advance,turning round; all bow or curtsey to partners.

First and third couples right and left to places.This is repeated by couples 3, 2, and 4 in order, each observing that they visit the couple on their right, then those on their left, and finishing by dancing right and left with their vis-à-vis
5. 	Grand chain. First couple face outwards. Couples 2, 4, and 3 in order back up into line, each lady being slightly in advance of partner. Ladies move to left and gentlemen move to right, then ladies to right and gentlemen to left. All cast off. The ladies to the left and gentlemen to right then form opposite lines. The four gentlemen join hands, and the ladies likewise. All advance and retire and turn partners to places.

	This figure, with all the others, is dances four times through. The second ime the order of forming couples is — 3, 4, 2, 1, also facing outwards; the third time couples 2, 3, 1, 4, facing outwards, also at the sides. In this figure grand chain always follows turn partners.

[^3]: [It is now the fashion for the four ladies to advance and courtesy to each other; then each lady turns to her partner and curtseys to him. The ladies do the moulinet while the gentlemen all move round outside the quadrille and return to places. This is repeated four times. The second and fourth times all the gentlemen advance, and immediately turn towards their partners and bow to them, and continued the figure as before]. We approve of this change as it suits tall and short dancers.

### {21} Coulon's, or double quadrille

Being in London when this quadrille was introduced and having had lessons from a Mrs. Nicholas Henderson, the compilers insert her descriptions. William Scott.

This quadrille is danced by four couples. All quadrille music will suit it. It is very easily learned. It has the same figures as the common quadrille, only so arranged as to be danced by four, instead of two couples; and to occupy only half the time of the common quadrille. This arrangement gives great additional variety and cheerfulness to the movements of the dance.

1. Top and bottom couples right and left, whilst the side couples dance chaine anglaise outside them. All four balance to partners. The four ladies form ladies' chain, or hands across and back to places. Half promenade, top and bottom couples chaine anglaise, whilst side couples grands chaine round them. This leaves all in their respective places.
2. The lady at the top, and the lady on her right, with their opposite gentlemen, perform L'ete (each forming a semicircle to the left in crossing over to opposite places). The remaining four do likewise.
3. {22} The lady at the top, and the lady on her right, with opposite gentlemen, dance La Poule (setting in two cross lines). The rest do likewise.
4. Top and bottom couples dance La Pastorale with the two couples on their right. The latter do likewise with top and bottom couples.
5. All galopade round. The top and bottom couples galopade forwards; and whilst they are retiring the side couples advance, and as they retire, top and bottom couples galopade to opposite places. Then the side couples do the same. Top and bottom couples readvance; and whilst they are retiring, the side couples readvance, and as they retire, top and bottom galopade back to places. Then the side couples do likewise. Double ladies' chain, and galopade round. Then the side couples begin the repetition of the figure, which finishes with a general galop.

Uniformity of step and correct measurement of time are particularly indispensable in the execution of this dance.

This quadrille is now very generally taught by the profession, the leading members of which were invited by mister Coulon to his house to give their opinion of its merits, and all agreed to introduce it to their pupils.

### {23} Parisienne

This is simply the first set. Arrange partners by forming two lines (as in Scotch reel). There being neither top or bottom couples. The music is only played half the usual length of time. This set only requires to be introduced to become a great favourite.

### Dances specially suited for juveniles.

>
> As those move easiest who have learnt to dance;
>
> Dancing is to the body as learning to the mind,
>
> Just as the twig is bent so is the tree inclined.

### {24} Come dance along with me

Gallopade or Singing Galop.

By William Scott[^6].

[^6]: The music for this dance and for the “Chimes of Dunkirk” may be had from mister Skinner.

> “Come dance along with me
>
> I will fill your hearts with glee”.

### [^7] {25} The Chimes of Dunkirk with chorus.

[^7]: In our professional experience we have, on many occasions, been requested to give a dance in which all may join. The re-arranging of the “Chimes of Dunkirk”, the beauty of the music, and the simplicity of the figure has, we trust, reduced it to the capacity of the merest tyro. The dance has another advantage — videlicet — It gives gentlemen the pleasure of dancing and singing with every lady in the room. This is _comme il faut_. William Scott + James Scott Skinner.

Any number of couples form a circle round the room. The gentleman having his lady on the right arm. At the first note of the music the gentleman makes a low formal bow in front of his partner. His partner makes a low formal curtsey (3 bars and 1 bar for the gentleman to return to his place).

Join hands and advance to centre of dance 1, 2, 3, 4 retire and readvance, upon retiring face the lady on your left. Your partner face the gentleman on his right. Strike the palm of the left hand with the fingers of the right (Keeping time to the music) and singing:

> “Oh! Listen to the chimes. Oh! Listen to the chimes”.

Turn the lady you advised to “listen to the chimes” and during the movement sing:

> “The merry, merry chimes of the Dunkirk bells”

Repeat until the ladies have regained partners.

{26} The Cellarius valse, redova & la gorlitza are all valses and cannot be learnt from books besides they are not popular and the introduction of too many dances into society entails more (illegible) on learners &c.

Eight times in all, each time turning half round. Second step occupies four bars. The gentleman slides the left foot into the second position, and steps behind with right, and hops upon it, then carries the left foot behind the right into fifth position: the above is repeated, the lady doing the same movements.

Both turn half round with one polka step and pause.

When this dance came out a third step was used. It is not now in vogue.
